I’m mentally the worst I’ve ever been but I haven’t cut myself in a year. It haunts me every day tho. I’m constantly getting horrible thoughts and the most disturbing visuals of my scars. Whenever I see someone with their thighs out I automatically imagine scars on their legs like mine. Even TV shows, movies, and cartoon characters. I cover them up with fake tattoos to try and ignore them and it kinda helps but I honestly feel like I’ll never be able to move on.",

I'm constantly with my boyfriend and I mean constantly. I don't feel like I can at all be alone and every time I am alone I cut myself. I just keep thinking of how I can attempt and I have many different plans I could use and they replay in my head 24/7. Yes I have a therapist, I'm in DBT, I'm still getting into the whole thing and she does really help, but none of my coping skills or anything help me right now. They haven't for months and I feel like I'm just being told to wait until it all kicks in, but I'm just getting worse and worse. My BPD is making me an absolute cunt to my partner and it just isn't fair and I know that and I don't want to fuck things up more than I already have. I just want to feel safe. I need to stop relying on people. I know what's wrong with me. I know what I can do, what I should do, but I just can't or won't. I don't know. I just don't have the energy. I need more help than I'm getting, but I feel like I'm not good enough for a psych ward or some shit. I feel like I'm lying to myself and I should just be fucking happy. I have a good job, I'm where I want to be in college, and it's taken me ages to get where I am and I know I can do what I want in the future, but it just doesn't feel worth living for. Never has. I just don't care enough, but I try to and I'm not going to say I don't care because I do. It's just not enough for me to actually give a shit. I had a very shit childhood (I know what a surprise) and I know that's probably why I'm so ungrateful, but why can't it just stop? I just want it to stop. I just want to feel safe, but I honestly think in the next couple of months maybe a year if I have no more improvement I will just kill myself. What's the point? I don't even see the point now. I just don't want to be here. I want to be better, but I feel so empty and detached and even if I regret it, at least it would all stop, it would be done, and I'd be OK with that.",

        "Post Text": "I feel trapped with no other way out. I am a young adult male living with my father and sibling, My mother left our house almost a year ago after a slow breakdown in the relationship of my parents. They split up after decades together and it was very unexpected so it hit me hard, especially as I am the youngest in the family. I was just finishing school and basically forced into getting a job because money was, and still is tight. I got a shitty traineeship that pays me dirt, doesn't teach me much, and has me doing a large amount of stressful work, getting yelled at on phones all day, dealing with abusive customers 40 hours a week with very little support. I can handle mentally strenuous situations though, or at least I could. The stress of work in itself is not my main concern. For the past couple of years, I've dealt with a couple of fluctuating chronic pain conditions. I don't really want to go into detail about it, but I guess the best way I could describe my condition is like, it's basically a hidden disability. Most days, I'm in pain, whether it's minor or significant, physical pain is there. But because I look relatively young and healthy, no one really knows or notices. I don't like to even mention it because I hate having to explain myself or sound like I'm whining or making excuses. It's not like much even changes when I do explain things, and my job certainly isn't the type of place where I'd get cut a break for this. I've tried getting medical help for my conditions, but the doctors just give me the same useless recommendations over and over again - \"get plenty of water and sleep\", \"it's a chronic condition, and you'll have to live with it\" etc. They really seem like they can't or won't help no matter what. I've been to counselling for my OCD, which is already pretty intense and draining, and though it helped a little, my OCD still persists pretty badly, and my therapist's recommendation that I keep pushing with my other doctors to find the right treatment for my other conditions hasn't really worked at all. Every time I go to the doctors for further help, I come home feeling even worse and more hopeless. I've since finished psychotherapy and I'm also on my own in that regard too. I feel so depressed and isolated from my friends and family now. All I do is work (in pain), come home, prepare for the next day of work (still in pain), try to force myself to do some pointless leisure activity (probably still in pain), and then sleep. Almost every day. I'm a shell of my former self. I'm in pain all the time. My family want me to help around the house, with things that I was never taught how to do. They yell at me pretty frequently but I try my best to do what I can when I feel like I have enough energy and when I'm not in pain. The pain mostly stops me from truly having any leisure anyways. I've fucked up all of my past relationships, even the ones in which my partner really loved me and deep down I love them back. I haven't been on a date in so long, or been hugged or kissed, or even complimented in person really. I used to at least have the time and energy to go out and meet people and have fun and actually feel like a normal young person. Now I feel too old and ill, despite literally just starting adulthood. I'm just so tired. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't see a way forward. I get this feeling sometimes that I'm decaying or dying or drowning. I feel like I'm living in a nightmare pretty often. I can't leave my job because I need to finish my traineeship, and I might get kicked out for being unemployed. I can't find any help for my chronic pain. All the help I've had was inadequate and it seems that such will always be the case. I have a horrible home life and social life, and don't have the energy to fix it because all my time and energy is spent on just barely getting through the work days whilst being in pain. I just live in regret. Things feel like they'll never go back to how they were. I cut myself earlier today after coming back from the doctors and learning that no further help was in store for me. I bandaged it and I'm physically okay at the moment, but I have work tomorrow and I already know how the rest of the week will go. I'm having thoughts of suicide again and have three different methods in my mind of how to do it. I can't see any other way out. I'm just trapped here. The only other option that comes to mind is having a brutally honest conversation with one of my parents about how I really feel - my chronic pain and self-harm - but I feel as though they'll just try to confiscate my SH tools and well, neither of them are doctors, so they can't help with my physical pain. I don't know what to do. I don't want to die but I don't want to live like this. I really can't see a way out of my current situation. I can't. I feel like I'm going to implode at any second because of all of this. It's all too much.",

        "Post Text": "I think I might kill myself soon. As said in the title, I think I might kill myself, I simply do not feel like I am alive anymore. These feelings or lack thereof are so overwhelming, I feel devoid. In my other posts on this alt account I have been struggling to handle this 90 degree nose dive of a mental state. I don't know what I'm looking for here, I just don't know, maybe it's to be heard? Because nobody else in my life knows anything of what I'm going to say. I have never told them. I keep getting these thoughts of hurting myself, these thoughts never leave, whenever I'm doing basically anything from exercise to music to writing all I feel is an innate desire to hurt myself so I can feel an emotion of some sort. I have been trying to uphold a frivolous facade of emotion for way too long, I'm tired. I do want to die. I think about it a lot, so much that when I'm alone I start whispering \"shut up, shut up\" in some pathetic attempt to silence my own thoughts, of which seem to act of their own accord. These thoughts often turn into plans, even written notes. Honestly, I don't know why I am here. Maybe because I am scared. But I doubt that, I think it's because of the people I have been working so hard to keep well, from a close suicidal friend to an insecure one with severe anxiety to those I have been trying to help online. Yet through all these things I do, I feel worthless, that others would still be chosen over me. I don't understand why I feel this way, but it makes sense. I am a quiet person, I barely if ever speak to those I don't have pre-established acquaintances with. Nobody really knows I'm there, I wish this was an exaggeration, but when my entire class didn't know who I was it hit hard. I know that is my fault, but it hurts nonetheless. Honestly, I want to die, but I don't want anyone to know it was suicide. There's no shame in suicide, but to the few it could hurt, it would hurt them dearly and even worse it could leave them alone without help. I don't really care as to anyone else's feelings outside of these select few, because they will forget, they will heal. But not those I'm trying to support, it could ruin them. I hope that one day when we grow older, we drift apart never to speak never to know and never to hear each other again, so that then I can die as I please without them knowing. I can even see it now. The final messages they sent to me, dated a year or so ago, I check their social media, they're happy with better life someplace else, and not a single recent message to me. I can't explain the joy I'd feel in that moment. Knowing I did the only fucking thing I have had. Then when I am completely gone from their lives I can be dead. This fantasy is intoxicating. I can hurt myself, I can do as I please to myself for that day or night without fear of tomorrow because I won't be there for tomorrow. I can drink because I don't drink, I can smoke, get high and cut myself as much as I want. A final crescendo before I go. Now as I write this I have noticed I have spiraled a little, I apologize. I won't remove it, I find that this raw expression might explain how I feel better than any self-censorship could. But I fear that I might do it earlier, maybe even in this year, I don't have any faith in myself to achieve what I should, and I feel that there is no point in trying. I am approaching college now, I'm meant to be doing coding, I fear I'll not make it and fail everyone.",

I'm mentally the worst I've ever been but I haven't cut myself in a year. It haunts me every day though. I'm constantly getting horrible thoughts and the most disturbing visuals of my scars. Whenever I see someone with their thighs out I automatically imagine scars on their legs like mine. Even TV shows, movies, and cartoon characters. I cover them up with fake tattoos to try and ignore them and it kinda helps but I honestly feel like I'll never be able to move on.",

I’ve always been seen as a pretty positive and cheery person, and for a while i think i was. but recently it was feeling more and more like a mask, like i was only doing it because i was supposed to. and then suddenly something just flipped and suddenly i cant feel ANYTHING anymore. nothing affects me, i feel like i dont care about anything anymore, i have zero motivation to do anything unless im absolutely forced to, and when i see friends i feel far away and paranoid that they’ll think something is wrong. i know im pulling away from people a little bit (not isolating just hard to talk) and i know they’re confused but i just dont feel anything. im sleeping too much, no motivation to eat. some days it’s not so bad and it honestly feels like everything else is like some sort of attention grab, but then i wake up the next day with a million pounds on my shoulders and a wrench in my head. the other day it all boiled over a little bit and i cut myself (not bad, i was scared), but it felt like that was the only way to make myself feel even scared again. i haven’t had any urge to since and i dont know if i ever will, but even that now felt like some weird cry for attention and that i like psyched myself into it somehow. even this post feels so stupid like im making up an issue and complaining about it because i just wanna feel bad or something idk because i honestly have never really had that many issues in the past what is happening to me?? why is everything falling apart all at once??",

My thoughts have become very, very dark. I’ve been hurting a lot. There’s a heaviness in my chest that I can’t get rid of. I have no motivation to do anything, no ambitions, no desire. I have not left my apartment in 3 days. I have tried 3 different SSRIs: Prozac, Lexapro and now Wellbutrin. But I haven’t taken the Wellbutrin recently because I felt dizzy and nauseous but this also probably due to the fact that I have no desire to eat. I have considered how I would do it (most likely I would have to cut myself or suffocate myself with helium). But I want to get out of this. I want to get out of this dark place.

'Its gonna be alright' is a phrase we've heard often and thats the very delusion ive chosen to feed myself now, that its going to be alright but deep down, i dont even know how to put it, deep down i feel like thats a lie even if i try hard to tell myself otherwise to save some bits of sanity and not go off the edge overthinking, i try to keep my cool think rationally that its not a fair deal thinking all is gonna go to shit for no reason but then finding reason to think the opposite, that all is gonna be fine, because its not going fine, these past few months ive just gone more and more off track the cheap optimism i feed myself keeps faltering day by day and what we end up with is despair and hopelessness, as i become a young adult slowly but surely responsibilities are gonna creep up on me, expectations to earn to perform to idk be the man of the house or something are eventually gonna be over my head like a damned guillotine and i dont know how the hell im gonna be able to meet them, im scared. Fear is becoming more and more of a common factor behind my actions, paranoia, am i gonna be able to earn? am i gonna be able to get a job? how the hell is that even gonna happen? the potential of failure scares the ever-loving shit out of me, perhaps thats why i never try, regardless though i feel more and more often that all doors are closing in on me, what i see for the future is effectively a dead-end, i keep telling myself that its gonna be alright that all will be well but have less and less faith in these phrases because thats what they are at the end of the day, words, meaningless.",

School hasn't been going smoothly and it's sort of like when you know stuff and want to do things but you simply can't because your brain fogs and you have no interest of becoming a better person than you are currently. I just see no point in life when I live in an unloved place, I hate feign confidence I know its false, I know telling people I have people who love me is false, NO one does, no one needs to. I hate hiding stuff which goes on to my friends thinking they'd be put down, I want to still have friends to proceed with a normal life hoping things will be alright, but it just won't work. I hate myself, I hate how I think, I hate that I can't be normal and happier and I hate how I have relapsed with self harm, I thought myself to be the biggest idiot ever to ever hurt myself due to mere people and now I am at it again, it's just a coping mechanism, it's just why should I love myself in a world where I'm not cared about much for, why? Psychiatrist clearly asked me to take a gap year after my 3rd suicide attempt which was almost successful my parents denied as my dad was afraid about university and my mom didn’t believe I was depressed. I was ok with their decision because I'm an ungrateful fuck either way. Time passed by, I started gaining interest, friends etc life was nice until I realized how I was doing utterly bad in exams, it didn’t really trigger anything in me because I'm pretty sure I'm capable of doing it, it’s not like it’s hard, I just needed to try better and so I did. I didn’t expect everyone to turn up against me, it gave me the surge of the past once again, lonely, miserable, alone, what not. I live in a room which echoes my own voice, haunted by my own thoughts and voices I'm feel like a lonely 30-year-old in a 16-year-old body, I don't want to show these feelings to my parents not in the fear of them yelling at me/hitting me rather in the fear of them stopping my education and dreams to leave abroad and this fucked up country and start a new life with newer people maybe this time I'll feel alone rather lonely. Teachers aren’t aware of this, I don't want to tell them, I don't want how my past self was underestimated and excused to doing hard tasks just because I was suicidal. But I just find peace in suicide now I just feel like all this drama and the need for validation from people and the need to be loved will end if I die. I really wish I could stop, I wish I could stop relying on others, I wish I could just idk study for myself rather than someone else, I wish I could be better, not depressed, I wish I didn’t have to fake being better to finally feel better, which once worked but not in the long run. I just want to be loved. Idk what it takes to be loved, I want to not just be the joker of the group, not just the helper of a group, not just someone to talk with, but a close bond with someone, who can hold me tight in tough times. I hate battling this alone, I hate it. I relapsed in cutting a few hours ago, it stings, it pains, I feel like I have nothing for me right now, it’s been a year and a half since I last cut myself, long time yeah? well it’s all gone, I'm back to square one except I don’t delusion things now, it's just cold depression, just depression where I don’t shut myself in my room and sob rather it silently creeps me now and then when I'm alone, in my head telling me no one likes me and I'm not worthy of love. I don’t want anyone to find out such thing happened, I don’t want them to, I'll once again be labeled weak and unfit. My biggest fear was to relapse, I couldn’t get the blade away from my skin, I just couldn’t, I wanted to harm myself so bad, as it kept getting near my skin adrenaline kept pushing me to do it, I did it bro, I did it. I will do it again, and again and again and again. You have no idea how hard it was me to quit cutting. It started again. . .I am scared, I'm super scared, I don’t want to die I really don’t, I have people I love, I want to be able to love, I want to be loved and feel it truly so bad, so bad.",

I have severe anxiety and attachment issues so I just can’t let anyone get close to me but I did and I fucked up. I have never dated a boy before only girls since I thought I was a lesbian but after 2 years I got back into contact with my old boy best friend and fell for him harder than I expected. My mood depends on how he acts and shit but he is not really romantic kind of guy of course we have some sweet moments when he tells me how much he loves me but the problem is I need to hear it all the time not 5 times a day. I don’t want to force him cuz I believe he is the guy I want to marry one day even though we have been going out for like a month. The pain when I feel like I’m losing him is getting worse I can’t breathe I can’t do shit. But that’s not the only reason I want to kill myself there is also family issues, mental illness, and everything. Today is my birthday, last night I had a panic attack it was really bad so I cut myself too much and realized I don’t want to deal with all of this anymore. sure I want to have my dream life with this boy I want to go on trips with my best friends but I just can’t there is more pain than happiness.

I made a new account because I don’t want to trace back to my own shit. My mental health lately has taken a huge turn and I feel like the sixteen year old who used to slice her thighs open and think “just cutting the cow”. I gave birth a few months ago and I can’t stand the way my body looks. I’ve had complications and more surgeries and now I’m bloated with a trashed abdomen. I can’t stand seeing myself in the mirror. I’m far away from family. Like half-way around the globe far. My partner is an alcoholic. I can’t pick up my baby right now because of the surgery and have to rely on them. Last night, they drank a little too much than what I was comfortable with and they blew up. I can’t remember exactly what they said, but I can’t shake it off now. I feel useless. I feel stuck. I feel like I’ve wasted my life. I want to cut myself again, but this time I want to slice my arms and I want to go so deep they never stop bleeding. I want to hurt. And I want to never wake up. I’ve been feeling this way for a few months. I know I have PPD. I’m on Zoloft for it and right now I’m also on gabapentin, Valium, oxycodone, and methocarbamol. I keep trying to numb it out and it doesn’t work. The only thing keeping me right now is my baby. I want to talk to someone, but I don’t like therapists. I’ve never had a positive experience with one. I could call a hotline, but what are they going to say? Don’t do it? What’s wrong? I told my partner it’s been on my mind and I think they’re a little worried, but… they make me feel so small every day. I have a friend I want to text but I don’t want to put this on them. I don’t even want to put this here, but I figure maybe it’s better if I write it out for strangers to willingly click on. I keep thinking I could find a babysitter while my partner is at work and I could do it. Close the door, leave a note not to come in. Write a letter to my baby to let them know it’s not their fault. Make a will of my wishes. I haven’t thought this way in such a long time. And saying it, I won’t. But I think about it. I think about it a lot. And it feels much more obtainable every day. I’m scared to talk to someone. Has anyone felt that way? I’m scared to admit I want to kill myself violently and ruin my face and everything left of my body. I don’t want to put that on them. I don’t want them to change how I act but I do want to talk. I don’t know. How do I get myself out of this fucking rut.",

        "Post Text": "I'm so sick of my bad breath and my body like the title. yeah. I think this isn't something that gets talked about often. I have horrible bad breath. There, I said it, to a bunch of internet strangers. I don't care anymore. It's not gum or teeth issues, as I maintain good oral hygiene, and good hygiene in general. It's partially hereditary because my biological father has it. I have stomach and intestine issues so there is basically no cure. I also (think) I have tonsil stones and possibly even that one bacteria I can't remember the name of. I have it all. It first started when I would notice people would cover their noses when I'm around. I became paranoid, and my self-consciousness increased tenfold. Even when I know, deep down somewhere, that sometimes, it is probably not my fault and it's just an unconscious reaction that some people have, I just can't help but feel terrible and worthless. It has gotten to the point where when people move their hands even a tiny bit, I would tense up and wish that I could just die. This has turned my life upside down. I hold my breath around others, to the point of suffocation. I became silent. I've basically grown terrified of people, and team events, and everything that involves stepping out of my room and everything I used to love. I walk 2-3 meters away from others. I sit at corners of tables. People sitting next to me are basically a death sentence to me. It smells on an empty stomach, it smells on a full one. It smells in the morning, at night, after I brushed my teeth, seconds after I use mouthwash, it smells all the fucking time. Even breathing through my nose emits that putrid smell. I wear a mask 24/7 and it still does nothing. Don't tell me I'm overthinking because I can literally smell it. I tried everything to get rid of this. I tried not eating, for half and full days. Nope, didn't help. Then I saw somewhere that you have to have good habits. So I tried eating healthily, and sleeping early, and exercising. Nope. I tried all the products I could find: mouthwash, those breath sweeteners, and everything on the market. Nope. I tried traditional Chinese medicine and herbal teas. Nope. But I want to socialize so much. I want to befriend people so much. I want to have conversations and tell people all about my favorite things. I want to do all these things. I have so much to give, but I just can't. I am jealous of other people who can be physically close with their friends and laugh with each other. I am jealous of people without this. I'm jealous, and so miserable. I also sweat an abnormal amount, and my body (especially my feet) smells so bad (also hereditary). The smell is literally permeating the dorm room right now and I want to die. I can't stop sweating at everything. I don't know any girl who has these issues. A girl with smelly breath, feet, and basically, her entire body? Who would want this type of person around. This sounds so bad but I'm just done. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being alive. I'm a walking biological bomb. I'm a nuisance to everybody. My mere existence is disrupting others. My existence is a scandal. I'm at camp right now, staring down at 7 days of pure torture and suffocation (literally, if I suffocate myself to death by holding my breath) ahead. These people are so nice. I wish I could befriend them but I know I can't. I'm sorry for disgusting them. I want to fake an illness, or actually make myself sick so I could get out of there and be less of a bother. I'm planning on going to a doctor to finally get to the bottom of this but I doubt anything (even medication) will help because it's hereditary and I have stomach problems. there. I said it. even this doesn't fully communicate everything. I just want to die. I want to carve the grime and muck from my body out with a knife. I want to cut myself apart.",

I have diagnosed clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, adhd and ocd, and have been really suicidal for a long time. My psychiatrist was asking me lots of questions the other day that I know is what they ask to diagnose bpd, and I connected with almost all of the questions, but then felt really angry with him and I never want to talk to him again. I feel like he didn’t treat me like a person and I hate him so much, but is this just in my mind? I don’t know. I thought he was really arrogant and abusive to me, but what if I’m just making this up? I feel like I’m going crazy. One day I’m depressed and suicidal, the next I’m so anxious and paranoid I can hardly breathe and my thoughts are racing. I feel empty all the time, so disconnected from myself and the world. I have no clue who I am and I want to die so bad. I feel like I’m a terrible person too though, cause I feel like what if I’m not actually sick and I’m making all this up for attention. I think there was a time when I felt ok, and somehow I ended up here. What if I’m just a psychopath and like hurting people and having people worried about me??? Like I cut myself too, sometimes cause I want to die, sometimes because I feel like I deserve to be hurt. And I try and hide my scars a lot but sometimes let people see them on purpose cause I feel like they don’t understand me, and then I feel like a terrible person because I’m playing on their emotions, but I just feel so misunderstood.

        "Post Text": "2020 was long ago but ever since then it feels like a flood of darkness has been unleashed by so much bad news, regardless of the sources. The waves of headlines keep hitting me mentally and emotionally so hard to question what's the point of trying if it really does feel like the end? First I want to say for the record with all due respect that I am not one of those who express their doomsday chants or preach end of days out loud at stop lights you may typically see around town. Normally I avoid venting this thought because I bottle it all up inside out of fear for being embarrassed over my point of view. I can't help it but open up now because the pressure of so many \"what if\" scenario questions quite frankly are giving me headaches whenever I'm exposed to even the smallest grim headline. In that moment, I have neither the urge nor energy to read the article itself because I know the overall message is just layer upon layer of icing on a doomsday cake. After I read the line, it then brings me back to reality where I'm only anticipating the worst for 2025 because the past several years have been ravaged by plague (COVID + its variants), mask mandates, famine (the constant shortages), inflation, the growing influence of A.I, trending exhibited behaviors of entitlement, and now a culminating fear of World War III that it’s getting heavier to accept what’s deemed \"normal\" to read about nowadays. I want to marry and have kids like everyone else my age (28) right now, but the world is regressing into a darker direction more than ever; making it hard to believe there’s any chance of hope to live with them in peace. The thought pattern impacts me so much so I binge eat just for an ease of comfort and/or I barely apply myself at work because I think \"hey, the world's already gone to hell, so why bother even trying for tomorrow's fate seems to be sealed?\" Despite all that has been painted by fearmongering news (regardless of sources), or up close by word of mouth in person; the real darkness that broke my faith in people is humanity stands at the point now where we don’t personally comfort, console, or provide each other enough with short simple words like “Everything is going to be alright” or “I’m here\". Texting, Facetiming, insta-messaging, or snapchatting certainly will never count. Let's face it - we are over-consumed by smartphones, materials, status, misunderstandings, amateur judgments, overzealous politics, personal fallouts, and polarizing attitudes. I’m no different for I’m neither perfect nor have I done enough to exemplify with my own faults like any human. The overwhelming picture echoes an exhausting list of doom & gloom pointers that are intolerable to imagine, which are hurting me on a grand scale to even wonder \"what hope is there tomorrow if today is darkened by our own damnation?\". Or quite frankly \"if the world miraculously does see the light of next day, how are we leaving it 'better' for future generations who will eventually clean up the mess we leave behind?\" I get that bad news is inevitable and part of human nature. I understand these are things that I can't control nor anyone else can for that matter. Bottom line is I'm sick and tired of falling into this repeated phase whenever my sense of hope is preyed upon by trending headlines. Although I completely cut myself off from subscriptions and any news outlets, eventually stories always come back around to haunt me. I just want someone to tell me \"everything is going to be alright\" , \"don't give up\", anything uplifting, and -even though it sounds cheesy - any fun good news/ fact to boost me up whenever I may fall into this place.",

        "Post Text": "NAT: Does your therapist have to like you to want to help you/ it to work? I know the answer is probably no, but I worry this might have been the issue in the past. I struggle to be totally honest with my previous therapists, little things they said or did really niggled me. I probably have superiority issues and have read a lot and tend to think I'm right, because I know I can be so easily led (this used to be overt, now less so, and I hate myself for thinking like it). I don't want to be led down the avenues of thought and lose myself in the therapy process. I'm worried my therapist thinks, oh gosh, here really is a narcissist, she's so spoilt and lucky. Her issues aren't even real issues. If that was the case to be what they're thinking, I don't know how I'd live with myself. But I'm at the point now, where I actually want therapy to work, not just to be a safety blanket. I did 18 months where I thought, as long as I have therapy, I won't kill myself, because I have this magic place where I will talk and it will be okay. But when the programme stopped (she was pregnant) I fell apart and realised I'd never actually learned or practiced the dbt skills I'd done in group. I'd forgotten them pretty quickly and I'd not gone through them with my therapist at all. I've mainly got through my darkest days (which have all happened to be when I'm not in therapy) through the internet, and unfortunately I've read a LOT about my own feelings/ thoughts (embarrassing). Sorry I've overspilled on this post for sure, I just don't know if I have to like my therapist, and If she has to like me. I've only been to one assessment, and it was all good, until she kind of summarised some recent suicidal actions as passive. Because to me, I was.. active? Yesterday I sat in a field with a razor blade in my hoody considering doing it. But I called a helpline and walked home. Maybe I wouldn't have done it. Maybe it was passive. I didn't mention yesterday to the therapist, only that I had tried a couple of times to give myself TSS and get sepsis from making a dirty razor blade to cut myself with. I know the last two were 10000% not suicide attempts, I'm not stupid. I just wanted to find a way to do it so it wouldn't look like suicide, or a way to give it to the hands of fate, like not try to, but try to. It was just that I want this mess I'm in to be fixed, And the apathy in me to stop, and the pain and guilt and shame to stop too. Turns out that's near impossible without crashing my car. But I don't want anyone else involved. I'm not suicidal, I've just been suicidal in the past and I once ended up in ICU and it was classed as 'serious' and sometimes now I think I'm suicidal when I'm not? Anyway, I hope beyond anything at all I haven't given anyone any odd ideas. I just don't know if you have to like or be liked by your therapist for it to work.",

        "Post Text": "I Recently wrote down how I felt. I felt like i wanted to see if i could get some support and to see what people thought. Ever since a game I had been playing for years ended, I've started to play less and noticed what's been happening around me. I always used gaming as an escape but never realized how badly I cut myself off from the world. I feel no meaning in my life. I started to reflect on my life and how I achieved so much in my little world, and now that it’s over, I feel wasted as a human being. I suffer from Crohn's, which means constant stomach cramps, mouth ulcers, and pain when I eat. I also have anxiety, leading to sleepless nights, overthinking, and acting on irrational thoughts. Autism makes me socially unaware and easily overwhelmed, turning me into my own harshest critic. This constant self-criticism makes me feel guilty all the time. As a result, I try to be kind and considerate to others because I know how much a single person's actions can ruin someone else's day. This affects my mental health because my brain tells me I need to be perfect. Additionally, I have dyslexia, ADHD, and OCD, which adds more challenges. My family has been a huge source of stress since I was young. My parents had me very young and couldn’t take care of me, so I was raised by my grandmother. My mother abused me, causing emotional trauma I can’t fully express. My dad was slightly better but didn't understand autism and hurt me emotionally by not being present. My grandmother raised me while working full-time, leaving little time for me, and she was overprotective. Even now, her parenting affects me, and I feel guilty for going against her wishes. When we moved to a bigger house to accommodate all my dad's kids due to court issues, I felt unsafe because of my history with my dad and siblings. I have a lock on my door to feel secure at night while dealing with constant anxiety. My siblings criticize me because I'm my dad's child, even though I contribute financially to the household. They question why I have an air-conditioning unit (for my severe hay fever) and why I don’t use the dishwasher (because of my sensitivity to food smells). They constantly ask for help and blame me for tech issues, making me feel like a parent to them. I recently broke down and cried in front of my few friends, but none of them knew how to help me, making me feel isolated and unwanted. I overdosed as a result, but it failed, and now I don't know how to feel. I want my pain and suffering to stop, but medically, it can’t. All I want is a partner to escape with, someone to listen to me and be with me, but I wonder if that’s too much to ask.",

        "Post Text": "I don’t know if I actually love my dad I’m a 14 year old girl and my dad is in his 60’s now. I have two half brothers from my dad’s side in their twenties and a little brother who is 11. Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve always been a bit uncomfortable with my dad. He seemed to like me much more than my brothers just because I was a girl, which I should’ve been happy about, but it just made me feel more weird. He’s always been really touchy; not necessarily in a weird way, just touching my shoulders or thighs a lot randomly. He traveled a lot due to his job so I stayed with my mom and brother for most of my childhood. Honestly, I preferred it that way. As I grew up a bit more, I started to pick up on how weird his actions were. For example, he likes to hug me at night before bed, but the last thing I do before sleeping is taking a bath and changing. He comes and knocks on the bathroom door every night, asking for a hug and every night I would tell him no, partly because I was naked and partly because I just didn’t like his hugs. He just told me to come out naked and he would close his eyes; I refused and waited for him to stop asking before I got out the bath but it was still kinda uncomfortable because he kept pushing it. Another time, I was sitting on the floor of a hotel we were staying at and my dad came out the shower fully naked and stood right in front of me to take my phone. I know he had a reason to do that, but it still made me feel really weird because his junk was super close to my face. Even though he was a little weird however, he seemed to try his best to be a good dad. He would travel all the way back home for parent teacher conferences, tournaments, or any important event in my life. Most notably however, is how he paid for the entire family. He pays for all four children’s tuition, housing, his ex and current wife’s (my mom) lives. It’s not like I’ve been the perfect daughter either. I’ve talked back, lied, gotten drunk, shoplifted, sent nudes and cut myself so I should definitely feel more grateful for his affection, but I always felt like something was strange about him. As I spent more time with my half brothers, (from my dad’s side), I started to find out more about him. Apparently he was very verbally and physically abusive to them when they were younger and he had a drinking problem, which would cause him to have episodes of anger and violence. He also had a cheating problem with my stepmother (I’m pretty sure my parents are cheating on each other now), which took a toll on her as well. As my brothers grew up, they started to have mental problems; the eldest developed lots of anxiety and the younger one became very depressed and started getting addicted to drugs, leading him being sent to rehab for years. My brothers and my dad are constantly fighting, but my dad has helped them with their careers, and they enjoy talking to other members of the family so they still come to family gatherings and things like that. Also, he treats my mom pretty badly. My mom developed a heart problem and got a heart attack, making it very dangerous to do exercises like running or swimming, which were her favorite sports. Because of that, she started to gain more weight. My dad started to talk about how fat my mom was getting to other people too, which really angers me. On top of that, he seems to flirt with younger girls in front of her. We were all invited to a wedding a month ago, and a beautiful 20 year old woman sat at our table. In front of strangers, my dad started talking about how “beautiful her figure has become since she’s grown up”, because he last saw her as a child. It doesn’t seem to bother my mother, but it really made me upset. I don’t really know how to feel about him at this point. I know I should be kinder to him, especially because he’s not going to be around for long (he has dementia) and he’s also had a pretty hard life. It’s just difficult to treat him kindly, especially because of what I know he’s done to my siblings, it just makes me feel like I’m betraying them in a way. I really needed to get this off my chest cause when I tell my friends about it, they usually think I’m joking so thank you for listening.",

I also have this dying urge to be in a abusive relationship, like I want my significant other to hit me and be possessive and just straight up like control me. Because I find that to also be pretty, and a part of me thinks that's fucked up because my mom and sister went through relationships like that and are happy that they got out of them and advised me to not be like them.

I had been told by a previous therapist that my body issues caused me to flirt with eating disorders and exercise addiction throughout my life, and I have been and still am prone to making rash choices with my body. I have done these things as attempts at reclaiming a fraction of control over how I see my own body, such as getting a lot of very colourful tattooing done. the last year or so a lot of light has been shed on these sorts of behaviours for me, as I found out I’ve struggled and continue to struggle with body dysmorphia disorder or BDD for a long period of time, and then even more recently found out I have ADHD, which really came as a surprise to me. Fortunately, I don't see me finding out these things as negative at all, and I actually feel vindicated in my decision making through my life in regard to my body now. I can cut myself some slack for barely eating and then going to the gym like 10 times a week to ''lean up''. Finding out about all of this also hasn't made me 'excuse' my behaviour either, but instead encouraged me to look inwards with more curiosity than fear, and to feel more comfortable communicating my experiences with other people than ever before. Don't get me wrong, BDD is still an issue, and it poses quite a threat to someone who is prone to hyperactivity and restlessness due to ADHD, as exercise will always be a likely product of that equation. But now that I understand how some of it adds up, I can ask the right questions and have meaningful conversations with communities like this one, and even more importantly with my therapist and other professionals that I'm now confident enough to seek help from. If anyone finds any of this relatable I’d love to hear your experiences, and quite honestly any advice you might have about anything I have mentioned. I'd like to think I'm making better choices now, for example I have just downloaded a couple of online therapy apps like Wangie to supplement my support systems. But I'm always open to new ideas!",

        "Post Text": "I don’t know what happened anymore This is going to be jumbled. I’m highly emotional and I just need to vent and I (31, NBi) have no one to talk to. I was in a great spot in my life five years ago. I was engaged to a wonderful woman, my family was relatively at peace and financially I was okay. I started transitioning and we broke up. No fault of hers, I just realized that amazing as she was and is, I want my life partner to be a man. I wasn’t enough for her, either, and we want different things in life. She wants babies and motherhood, I can maybe adopt a teenager. It’s all been downhill from there. I got in a relationship with an emotionally abusive alcoholic, I did manage to buy a condo to get out of the relationship and I’m working on making it a safe space for me. That space was kind of sullied when I almost was a victim of a hate crime my first day here but that’s just how life goes. THATS just the recent backstory, though. Since I was a kid I had a massive fear of dying. It’s a lot better now, but I’ve always gotten antsy, irritable, anxious, and depressed around my birthday ever since I learned what dying was. My birthday is in about three weeks, so it tracks. My family doesn’t seem to understand it no matter how many years I’ve told them “I don’t want to do anything for my birthday. I hate my birthday.” We usually settle on a family dinner, one where I am told to choose and usually have to defend my choice, so I can appease them and then that’s that. This massive fear of death doesn’t really do much to want me to stop from dying. Like, I don’t actively have a plan and I wouldn’t go through with it anyways but I think all my pets may/would benefit from someone else if they knew I died. Especially when I’m like this. Lately I’ve just been having daydreams about cutting myself again (I’m 7 years SH free) and genuinely don’t see the harm in it. I give myself shots weekly, not like the hurt is that much different. But I’m broke and self harm isn’t an indulgence I’m willing to pay for. I just want to know what it’s like to not be hurt all the time. To not be scared, to not have to cut myself off at the knees and be told I’m selfish for fighting for what I want. I want to exist with my animals and not get irritated by them. I hate when I lose my temper, even if it’s maybe twice a year. I want a functional relationship beyond the support of my sister and mother, who are all I have left anyways. So, yes, not being alive feels like the better option. But I love my nephew, I love my animals (aka my girls) even when they drive me crazy. I know they’d miss me if I wasn’t alive. I’d miss them if they went anywhere else. I just don’t want to hurt anymore, I don’t want to be scared anymore. I want my front door to unlock when I put the code in, I want my blinds to go up and down when I pull them. I want life to be fun again. I want to laugh again. I want to be able to set a goal and actually meet it. Or I just want like… a really good coma.",

Needless to say I cut her out of my life (no pun intended lol), but unfortunately I still have scars from the encounter. I have no history of depression, anxiety, or suicide. It was just a stupid decision I made at 12 or 13 (5+ years ago, currently entering my senior year of high school). I have also never been on medication, tried drugs, drunk alcohol, smoked, etc. I am interested in applying for an AFROTC scholarship and eventually going into the Space Force as an engineer. I think I am a pretty competitive candidate. I have a 1550 SAT and 3.93 GPA. I'm working the physical part at the moment (I'm not overweight or anything, just bad at running), but I could probably pass the PFT if I took it tomorrow (even if it was not by a lot). I'm mostly just worried that I will be medically disqualified, even if I apply for a waiver. I've seen extremely mixed advice online regarding self-harm scars. Some people adamantly believe you should try to lie at MEPS and others insist on being honest and hoping to G-d that you get a waiver. It feels dishonorable to lie, but I love this country and I want to serve and protect it. I don't want that option to be taken away because of a stupid decision I made in middle school. Any advice?",

I have been depressed for ages, I am on a list for antidepressants but being honest it's not going to happen for months, I am constantly in pain. I have lost my childhood due to chronic illnesses and I just keep getting more and more illnesses the longer I live. I am happy sometimes but there is always an underlying sadness. I don't know I'm just ranting. I love life but I don't like living, I've never felt like I belong here (here in general as in earth). Because of being isolated from society from the ages of 9/10 to 15 I'm very awkward when it comes to interacting with other people, I don't struggle to make friends but I'm not great at making jokes or being normal. I'm constantly told I am unusual and have been since a young kid but that doesn't make me feel better?? At around summer 2023 I began to get better but then more things that were wrong with me popped up so I had to stop basketball which was the only thing I was really any good at anymore(wasn't even very good at that due to missing out on so much time, I began play at 6 but then had to stop once I began getting ill). I don't think I'll ever find anyone to love me either so what's the point in living just to be in pain? Are the happy times really worth this? I will miss my friends and family of course but I don't know. I don't even know if I want to die or just feel nothing. I've always flirted with the idea of being emotionless, I'm quite a sensitive person so my emotions control me easily. I wish I could just get rid of them and feel nothing, I think I'd like to be a sociopath. It sounds nice. Maybe this is all just a cry for help? I tried to kill myself when I was 12 but was too pussy to do it. I tried at 16 as well but my mum caught me. This is another reason why I hate myself, if I could get rid of my feelings I could just kill myself. I can't even fucking cut myself because I'm too much of a pussy. I think I will do it, I'm going to write letters and explain. I feel sad but I also feel a wave of relief, I do feel bad about doing this but really does any of this matter in the grand scheme of things? My friends and family will get over it eventually, I would. I will definitely miss the nature as well but it will be worth it. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get this off my chest. P.s- I don't need advice on why I shouldn't do this, I already know what y'all will say. + I have already tried calling helplines and ironically enough none of them have picked up, I say that gives me even more of a sign to do this.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Edit: Hi, I'm still here. Thank you for everyone who reached out through DMS and thank you for your comments on this post, I truly thank you all. I was asked how I feel now, idk. Your comments have given me insight but now I'm just more confused than I was before. Before I was sure that this was what I wanted to do and I think I still am but not I keep going backwards and forth about it with myself. I know it would be a selfish thing to do but idk if I can care... I know that sounds terrible but idk. I fear if I do stay for the sake of my friends and family I will just end up resenting them for it. Edit: Hello everyone, This is OP's sister. We found her dead a couple of days ago. I wanted to look through her phone to look at photos, and maybe get a reason as to why she did this and then came across this post as a notification came up. We all knew she was suicidal but we thought it was impulsive as opposed to being planned, she had, had attempts before but always called someone Beforehand. She was also happier but now I think I understand why. Me and the rest of her family would just like to thank you for trying to help her through this, even if it was in vain we still very much appreciate you all giving her so much love even though she was a stranger to all of you. Thank you.",

I've always had anger management issues, especially as a teen, but it has gotten increasingly worse over the last few years. I resort to hurting myself, so as not to hurt others. It started with biting my hand, which wasn't too harmful. A few weeks ago I gave myself a nasty bruise on the face because I punched it with my fist. Today I took a wooden spatula and smacked my legs so hard with it that I now have a significant amount of swelling and bruising. There has been a lot more but you get the gist. A friend of mine suggested I also might have borderline personality disorder, but honestly, not many other symptoms match me, except for the anger issue ones. I especially connect with the feeling of an inner tension that I *need* to get out somehow. What are your experiences? Have you had similar issues? Have you done any therapy or other tactics to combat it? Thank you for your help. Edit: Maybe I should add that I'm in therapy as well as medicated. I have tried different methods of dealing with my anger but the self harm seems to be the only way to \"contain\" it to only myself.",

        "Post Text": "I lost my chances to die for other and im not sure if im happy or not about it. This is a rant as im losing my mind right now so maybe the title wont fit by the end of it. I've felt empty for years. Ive gotten used to think of it as a rotting dread, just the feeling crawling at the back of my mind all the time, that i have to actively distract myself to get it to shut up. I remember when i was a teenager, i was sad yeah, i was typically suicidal only in show, whatever i felt back then i feel is puny and wasnt worth the suicidal thoughts or attempts, but sometimes i wake up wishing i did make it back then, even if whatever broken heart or mean joke wasnt worth enough in my eyes to kill myself at least then i would have been more up to do it than now. I had friends with problems, with real problems, with real suicidal thoughts with real reasons that even i found hard to argue against. So i shut down any attempt i foolishly tried to have back then just to support them, to lie to them and tell them we could do it together. I kept doing that for years, ive got hurt when they did get better, especially when getting better also meant getting far from me. Because some just didnt want to be around someone sad, because some just drifted away, and in the worst cases cuz i grew resentful and possessive the more my frustration grew and i damaged some. Its been 14 years since the last time i cut myself because i made a promise with a friend that if she hurt herself i would too. I made my life since then to try to help the people i cared while trying to get them to throw their pains at me and have some peace. Im happy for her, she did get better, she will get married. But i feel so jealous. Ive become so jealous of everyone, cuz the brighter they became the bleaker the world became to me. Ive always been smart so i never failed academically even when i tried. Ive had connections so even if i wanted i couldnt be jobless. My anxiety makes me quite social for some reason so its easy to talk to others and make superficial friends. But the world. The world became so pointless over the years. All the people i helped became better, why am i worse. I feel like a mask. I dont remember what i originally desired, only know the ideal i became to help others, to feel good with myself. I feel everything i am is lies. I feel everything i do is pretending. And it was fine. Until i broke. The rot at the back of my mind started becoming louder and louder and i became worse at helping, worse at talking, worse at finding good things to say, to think, to distract me with. I found myself finding doing anything harder and harder, just moving by a sense of responsibility. Ive found me falling while going upstairs because myself suddenly gives up on finding a point to move. I tried pills. I got to the doc and got checked and got some antidepressants hoping it was just something bad with my brain but when the incessant noise disappeared with them i still felt empty. Funnily enough while being on them, as i became calmer and more rational, i almost killed myself. I had everything planned and prepared, the only reason i didnt is because my uncle died of sickness. I just rationally thought \"two deaths so close are too much, ill postpone it.\" But then the bleakness invaded even that. Death sounds pointless now. As bleak as anything else. At least the noise keeps me entertained, be it short lived joy with friends i will never open to again or nights alone tormented by whatever dark thought i have in my mind. They somehow feel better than the emptiness. But even them are starting to fall down recently. I feel it crawling and ruining my mind more often. I find everything so pointless, every step such a burden every fake smile so useless. I know that when i die of natural causes i will be loved, but i feel im getting stuck, that i will become a burden. That i will fail to look like someone that makes others want to try to love life, because i do believe they can, because i do believe they have dreams and hopes contrary to me. And it annoys me, it vexes me. All my effort thrown to shit because of this incredible sense of dreadness and emptiness. If it was gonna be like this, i wish i would have just killed me when i had the drive even if my reason was not worth it. Ive already disappointed everyone unable to cherish life, that now i cant even properly act as a fake for it, when i always took pride on my ability to lie, its so vexing. How worthless can i be.",

He used to talk with me almost every day on the phone for 2 hours while serving sentence and he's such a wonderful father, my mother also told me that my father would never say bad words to his family and we will be a whole family again once he gets released. He got released in 2013 and everything went wrong. He probably learned how to curse people in the most vicious language in prison. Everything he said in life was full of curse words. He also had symptoms of alcohol addiction. The first time I was beaten was also 9 yrs old because I cried and said I wanted to stop school. He pinched my neck, cursed me, slapped me, and asked me why I didn't die. That was the first time I knew that a slap could be made with the whole palm of the hand on the face instead of from the side of the face. From that day on, I was beaten more and more frequently by him. At first, I was just choked, but then I was slapped, kicked all over my body, and hardcover books were thrown at my face. Even when I fell to the ground with my head covered in my hands, he continued to kick my head. I also used to get beaten by my elder brother who was 6 years older than me and none of my family came out and protected me. Even my mother, she would sit in the bedroom with the door locked and ignored me. I'm a grown adult now but I found out I kept having flashbacks since I was 14, I would lock myself in the bedroom and cry for hours. I was angry but there's nothing I can do, I used to cut myself and drop classes when I was a teenager. At one point I was so busy with work that I thought I had recovered. I would only have flashbacks occasionally. But after I quit my medical assistant part-time because my manager made me remind my father somehow. the flashbacks started again it's still going on. My mother said it's because I'm too emotional, there are many people who have trauma that are much worse than me and only I got so emotional and selfish. I talked to my father once and he said it was because I deserved it because I made the mistake.",

This is going to be my first Reddit post ever, cause when I googled my question I couldn’t find any answers, so I’m here now seeking some anecdotes as answers. Starting last Friday, I had a mental health crisis and found myself having only thoughts of suicidal ideation for like half of the day. Then the weekend came and I was okay, still emotional, but definitely not as bad as Friday. Monday comes around and in the car on the way to work, my thoughts turned to suicide again. It was so bad I had to seek professional help and have an emergency crisis session with my therapist and the mental health clinic I go to had to send someone to pick me up because I didn’t feel safe enough to drive myself to the clinic. So I got help the help I needed on Monday, stayed at the clinic all day, and eventually went home. Now today (Tuesday) I almost feel fine, still depressed sure but I haven’t felt like k-wording myself today. Can someone tell me why my suicidal ideation, thoughts, and self harming behavior seem to switch on and off so quickly in this way?",

You get older and people care less. I don’t have a single friend I’m so lonely and don’t have anybody to go to when I am sad. I feel like I don’t have control over how I feel.

You guys might say 'oh but you’re so young, these are the best years of your life!' These have been the worst years of my fucking life. Ever. I’m sick of everything, so many different factors come into play here, I’ve had these thoughts in my brain for almost 4 years now. I’m just so sick of it all. So, I’ve made a decision. On August 3rd, because 3 is my favorite number, I will attempt suicide. I will probably do it using a mix of random pills I can find in my kitchen (Prozac being one of them) and self harm. I don't know if it will even work. I don't know if I hope it will, or if I hope it won't. I just don't know. All I know is that I can't deal with life anymore, and at least if it does fail, it will truly show all the people I know how much I’m suffering. Because they never once truly understood, so maybe this will change their minds. But that's only if I don't change my mind before that date. Maybe some life-changing thing will happen and I won't end up doing it, maybe. But right now? August 3rd. I will update you guys if anything interesting happens with my life, and I'll make sure to leave a goodbye post if I do end up attempting. If I survive, I'll let you guys know. Thanks a lot.",

I started self harming around the beginning of this year, but stopped because of my best friend. he doesn't want me to leave and he told me it won't help my situation. I get it, it doesn't, but it makes me feel better. I have ADHD (I take medicine), possible depression and suspected BPD. I'm also deeply insecure. it's gotten better over the years but all the negativity has went other places. instead of being insecure about my body, I'm insecure about my self-worth and intelligence. I get A's and B's in school but not without struggle. I'm always everyone's second pick and I feel as if nobody will really miss me when I'm gone. I get that I'm privileged, and more than average in smarts, but I feel so stupid. I get bullied and I've been bullied my whole life. when I tell people I want to be in the medical field when I'm an adult, they laugh. I've had people tell me I'm too stupid to be a doctor. I tell myself I'm too stupid to be a doctor. I'm completely worthless. I was groomed twice. I have just, trauma from having the internet so early in my life. the whole works. I'm so 'broken' that I'll never be able to have a normal life. I want to change the veterinary medical field, I want to make a mark on the world, but I don't think I'll be able to do that. I stopped caring about my future, I don't think I'll have one. I'm sorry this is kind of cringe or maybe dramatic of me, I've had these thoughts for a while and I want to kill myself. I don't want to be here anymore. there's not a point in being here anymore and 'sticking it out' because the thoughts just get worse and worse. I thought of turning to religion (I'm being raised agnostic) but I don't think God will accept me. I don't think Jesus will accept me for how I've talked about religion in my life.

I’ve been struggling with a pretty extreme bout of depression, and my partner has been supporting me from afar (ldr). She’s called me a handful of times when necessary, and is very concerned about me falling back into old habits. Tonight, she was out/busy doing something fun, and I couldn’t make myself ruin her evening by reaching out (and no friends were available for a quick pep talk), and I relapsed. I’m incredibly ashamed, and even moreso worried about her reaction. I’m concerned that she’ll think I’m too risky or damaged, and break up with me. We’ve talked about my history of self harm before, but she hasn’t been with me when I was actively harming (we’ve been together 2 years). How should I deal with this situation? I know she’ll feel extremely betrayed if she discovers the truth at some point in the future, but I also know that she’d be upset and guilty if I told her now. I could keep it a secret, but I’d struggle keeping it from her. What’s the best way to deal with this?",

        "Post Text": "I need help. Very long read. I've been living abroad for two years. I've never really had a family. My family is quite fucked up, everyone is always fighting, it's incredibly divided and my parents are two people who should have never been parents. For both sides of my family, me and my two sisters were mistakes because of the huge age and social status gap between my parents, so growing up I had very limited exposure to aunts, uncles, and cousins. Grandparents are dead except for my one grandma, who is in a religious cult so I limit my interactions with her instead. The few adults around me were always unstable in some way. I went through physical and psychological abuse from my mother, and extreme financial trauma from my father. My father was a narcissistic gambling addict who married 4 women, had two families in which he was absent, ended up homeless and now has cancer. My mother is mentally unstable and went through extreme post partum depression after having my little sister, who is disabled. We (me and my sisters) experienced great neglect from both parents, too. We were always financially struggling and couldn't afford proper meals sometimes. Whenever I tell anyone about my childhood in detail, they always joke that it seems like I pulled it out of a movie. Still, these last couple of months I find myself crying for my parents every night, even though I know they wouldn't help me if they were here. I have no one asking me how I am, what I'm doing. No one in my family speaks to me unless spoken to. I believe that if I were to kill myself today, no one would find out until my body starts to smell and decompose. I've never had many friends. I always suspected I'm neurodivergent or have some kind of personality disorder other than depression, if you can call it a personality disorder. Ever since I was a toddler, I was extremely shy and incapable of proper socialization. I know this for a fact because a couple of years ago I found some of the letters my pre-school teachers used to send my parents, in my mom's memory box; they all said the same thing in different words which is fascinating really, since the letters were all from different teachers and different years. Basically, \"She's a very capable child, but does not socialize with the other kids\". I don't know what's wrong with me, really. I know something has always been wrong, but I haven't been consistent enough to find out what. Been to countless therapists and every single one ends up sending me to a psych who prescribes me some drugs, then I cannot afford all this therapy and drug-buying, so eventually I stop going and taking my meds. The cycle repeats every couple years. I struggle with routine. I never stick to anything and leave everything halfway- be it hobbies, projects, ideas, studying, my own health, etc. I have really bad anxiety, which kicks in in waves. At times, I'm struck with really bad health anxiety and I worry over an illness that I probably don't have for weeks or months. Sometimes, I over-obsess over a stupid problem that I have, making it the center of my universe for weeks on end, too. I self harm via risky behavior- reckless drinking, spending, drug abuse, sex, hygiene neglect. I have an eating disorder and my BMI is way below healthy, some days I eat one meal, some days I eat nothing at all. I cannot stand being alone and constantly seek company to keep myself distracted from my own life and responsibilities, even if it's bad, bad company. This leads to severe attachment issues which end up hurting me and other people in the process. Whenever I have to spend days alone, I get suicidal. I lie to people, a lot. First it's white lies I tell to protect myself, then they escalate. This has also led to me jeopardizing my relationships with people and losing them, reason why I don't really have anyone anymore. I have no meaningful relationships, no one I can call right now who I'm sure will show up if I'm in a dangerous situation, and no one I can really open up to. I know something is wrong with me, but I don't know how to fix it. And I feel as if I've neglected it for far too long for it to be fixed sometimes. I'm a horrible person. Recently I lost probably the most important human connection I've ever had, and the way we've both been handling it has been extremely toxic. My boyfriend of almost two years (yes, we got together only after a couple months of me moving here. I'm not used to navigating life here without him, we used to live together) broke up with me after an endless cycle of us fighting, breaking up and getting back together for months. Soon after, I tried to fill the hole he had left in me with other men, but it did not work out well at all. I ended up getting used for my body and publicly making a fool of myself. Then, he came back into my life wanting to be friends, but it has been a complete shitshow involving not just us but other people, too. We started seeing each other often, being intimate and fighting, again. He finally put a stop to it yesterday when he said farewell to me forever, and I've been going crazy ever since last night. I don't have a plan yet, I just don't have any more hope for myself, either. I believe I'm an insane, horrible person, and natural selection should've done its thing a long time ago. The more I realize how far I am from fixing myself, the more I want to give up. I need help.",

I was recently at a youth (we're talking 5-8 year olds) sporting event where the seemingly 'normal' adults were complaining that the team was losing because the less skilled players were there and I had an epiphany. I hate my mental illness. I hate that my coping mechanism of choice is self harm BUT I'd rather be the adult literally ripping myself to shreds at the end of the day than the adult criticizing 5 year olds playing a sport for the first season ever. I'm all for a little competition but people are just awful. If you're a parent who thinks this way... maybe at least try not to verbalize these thoughts at sporting events... or around your kids. It's bad enough hearing it from adults on the sidelines but I can only assume you're teaching your kids to think the same way and they're saying the same crap on the field to their teammates. My mental illness sucks and my self harm might be ugly but thinking that it's perfectly okay to whine and complain because your 'elite athlete' of a 1st grader lost a meaningless game because of his unskilled, young teammates, is a lot uglier. Your kid might not make the goal but I'll still clap because they tried. I might have 5,000 reasons that I think I should die but I will sit here and provide anyone I can with 5,000 reasons they shouldn't die. The reminder that people like this exist doesn't help with my mental health issues and only provides me with less hope for the future but I guess I just wanted to share that if you, like me, feel like you just don't belong in this world, maybe you aren't the problem.",

I have suggested he attempt counseling and he refuses, fine... however, idk what to do anymore... my partner and I have been together for 9 months, we are currently 26 weeks pregnant. It is my first, but his 4th. He has an 11-year-old at home and a 5 & 6-year-old that live with their mom in AZ. He has a hard time that he cannot see his Littles. I completely understand, to an extent. He lets this all bring him down constantly. However, my logical brain is having a hard time being super sympathetic, I know it isn't fair? Can someone offer some insight on his part? I do not struggle with depression nor his life circumstances. So, he's 31, almost 32, 3 kids, 4th on the way. 3 baby mommas. The 11-year-old is at home and the mom has no part in her life other than abandoning her, twice. She struggles with severe mental health issues. My partner, her dad, has a very lax way of parenting; he doesn't make her go to school. She has no chores, no responsibility or accountability whatsoever. She trashed her room by hoarding trash, I'm talking mold, etc. She has a binge eating disorder where she is now 5'1 and approaching 200 lbs. She talks about self-harm... the works. He's very absent in the fact that I don't see them interact much when she is at home... Anyways, she's been gone for the summer and this is affecting my partner. He also usually has his Littles for the summer and this year the mom decided she is not going to allow him to have them, nor even video chat with them as they agreed. I have no idea why she's doing this other than... she found out I was pregnant and also he was not prepared to have them at all. He had no child care set up, he has no car, and he's been working very few hours and can't even afford food for himself. With all of this, obviously, being depressed in general, he is struggling. In my brain, I'm having a hard time because I feel like all of this is created by him. He's not working, he's not looking for another job or other income, he sent his oldest away because she wanted to visit family in another state (now is begging to come home as they have rules for her), he ultimately feels bad he can't bring her home RIGHT now because he's broke AF (I think her being gone and learning rules and responsibilities is good for her, but what do I know), he's sad his Littles aren't here... I am not a monster, I get that not having your kids must be sad, but he refuses to work toward changing his circumstances. Any ideas how to 'help' a depressed person move toward positive change? He won't work toward having more money, he currently has so much debt from making terrible purchasing decisions that he could never afford and won't do the work to file for bankruptcy. He won't make small changes so his daughter's behaviors change because they're stressful AF. He won't call his insurance in order to get his information so he can take care of his own health issues -- mental, dental, and other physical needs. Him and his daughter are overweight, but they will not make changes to become more healthy despite making comments about feeling uncomfortable and unhealthy. He won't seek help for counseling or meds for his mental health. I've also tried to break up for many reasons and EVERY time he threatens suicide because 'he can't handle another loss on top of his kids.' One, I know he can't put that on me... and I can't stay just because of this. But I'd love for him to be happy for himself and his FOUR kids. Is there any hope?",

The thoughts have been getting worse over the past few weeks but every time I start getting depressed I think it'll be fine. I took one of those online risk assessment tests and it said I was 'severe risk' and that I need to seek 'immediate professional assistance or visit the ER'. My next therapy appointment is the end of next week. I don't think I'm too suicidal, like I have a plan and stuff but I haven't relapsed with self-harm or gotten the things to do it. I don't want to tell anyone how I'm feeling for a few reasons. Last time I was in the ER my mum made it about herself and said I was selfish and me wanting to die stressed her out so much she wanted to check into a mental hospital. Another reason is I don't want them digging around my room. I'm 18 but they don't like when I drink (it's legal here) so I would hide bottles in my room, there's like 8 empty vodka bottles and I'm scared they'll think I'm an alcoholic and never let me drink again if I don't kill myself. Another thing is weed. They themselves smoke weed but they would be mad knowing I have a stash. I also smoke cigarettes, which they don't know. My mum only knows I vape. They're both smokers and my whole life would tell me it's bad. I really really want to tell my therapist but I'm scared she will make me go to a hospital. I have bad experiences at normal hospitals and I've heard bad stuff about mental hospitals. I'm also scared because I know my family wouldn't visit me. They never did when I was in the normal hospitals.",

I've always thought of myself as a boy and forever will be one at heart. I'm also an atheist, lol (it'll make sense once you read it). What really hurts me, though? Is the number of suicide notes I wrote; they were always about hating my family, friends, lifestyle and the things I did to feel alive for once (downing pills, alcohol, self-harm). I was out of it and in my own world, not once was I present during my depressive episode. But one stood out; it was five days after my attempt, and before writing and typing away at my phone; I want you to know that I'm Cree, first nation's, I have certain ceremonies I follow. Anyways; I'm completely out of it, I wasn't medicated and wasn't ready to see the whole world again but my mom takes me out to a ceremony anyways, I'm fine with it, it was a distraction for everything, I needed to get out so it was okay. What wasn't okay was the fact that my mom told the guy running the thing (I still have no idea what she said). After the ceremony, I get inside the car, ready to leave, never wanting to come back and just wanting to go home. My mom tells me to go inside the house, I listen with hesitation, heading inside, he gives me a harsh speech that if I ever commit again, I would curse my family, the deep cuts on my arms were a curse, I wasn't the one owning this body but it was creators (gods body). . .and of course I know THAT, we are the brains and not the body but what's fucked is this guy put it all in God's name, I was angry, I was close to breaking down. . .my mom didn't say anything. What the hell was he going to say if I succeeded? I hated my mom and the religion she believed in, I didn't like her at that moment. Once we got home, I went up to my room and cried like a big baby, biting my arm so I wouldn't make a noise. I then write down in my notes about my experience, I was hateful, angry at everything, I hated everything and everyone, which leads me to write at the bottom; 'that the next time I get the chance, I'm going to blow my fkn brains out!' (reminder: I don't and won't ever have access to a gun, I'm on the right meds, and I'm fine, I just really hate the person I was before. And NO, I'm not shitting on religious ppl. You can believe whatever you want, but I just can't anymore with religion/anything that involves a God.)",

I’ve been struggling with a pretty extreme bout of depression, and my partner has been supporting me from afar (ldr). She’s called me a handful of times when necessary, and is very concerned about me falling back into old habits. Tonight, she was out/busy doing something fun, and I couldn’t make myself ruin her evening by reaching out (and no friends were available for a quick pep talk), and I relapsed. I’m incredibly ashamed, and even more so worried about her reaction. I’m concerned that she’ll think I’m too risky or damaged, and break up with me. We’ve talked about my history of self-harm before, but she hasn’t been with me when I was actively harming (we’ve been together 2 years). How should I deal with this situation? I know she’ll feel extremely betrayed if she discovers the truth at some point in the future, but I also know that she’d be upset and guilty if I told her now.

        "Post Text": "Please help! Ignore spelling. Hello! I am a young girl in my teens currently struggling a bit. I’ve noticed these feelings only started recently, over a month ago. It might just be because it's summer and I'm bored and haven't really left the house much. I have friends and I'm not being bullied or anything. Basically, I've just been sleeping really late and waking up extremely late. I've been getting 8-12 hours of sleep, usually 12, but I still feel extremely exhausted. I don't want to get out of bed a lot of days. I don't brush my teeth some days and don't want to clean my room even though I used to be a clean freak. I also skip showers a few days often. Today I only had a bowl of rice. I haven't been eating often lately with only eating a piece of bread for breakfast and an actual meal later in the day. I want to eat and I'm hungry but I get nauseous (not out of fear of gaining weight). I'm barely drinking water but trying to drink more because a lot of this is probably dehydration (which leads to constipation I guess, which is something I've struggled with for years). I use to get stuff done by monologuing but I just can't do that anymore after realizing I only do it because my life is sad and pathetic but it was the only thing that helped me anyway so I wish I still did it often. My parents only recently realized this because my mom had me peeling potatoes but it wouldn't peel and I felt too weak to do it and just burst into tears. I feel like they haven't been helping me although they try. I cry a lot more. My parents wanted us to leave the house and I just started crying because I didn't want to. My sister got mad at me and asked why I was crying but in honesty I didn't know (combined with insecurity over acne and my body and my face). I don't know why I feel this way and everyone says “how are we supposed to help you if you can't tell us” but they don't get I can't put it into words. When I tell them that they get even more mad. My mom and dad recently signed me up for swimming classes, idk if it's because they want me to be active. I didn't want to do it but my mom says I don't want to do anything so she has to make me. Today was my first class and it was agonizing and embarrassing. I hate the way the swimsuit fabric clings to my body and it's just weird. I hate the feeling of getting out the pool and being uncomfortable wet on the forty-minute drive home. I hate the smell and the way the pool water burns my face. But I can't say this or I'm just gonna get called a baby. Not only was it uncomfortable, I'm just bad at swimming. My core is weak and my stamina sucks. You can't just throw me in a pool after a month of bedrotting. I barely had the energy to swim even with the floatie. I had to ask the teacher if I could take multiple breaks because I literally couldn’t breathe. Sunday night my mom told me I had swim classes the next day. That was the first time I seriously tried to self-harm. I took a box cutter which was incredibly dull and started cutting. They weren’t even deep and they look pitiful and I just cried and thought I was stupid. I was telling myself that I wasn't even depressed and was just doing too much, and that the cuts were too shallow to even be sh. After this, I stopped caring a little and took it kind of far. My dad made me get my stuff to go to the class and I just said I would kill myself but he didn't take it too seriously. I don't want to kill myself because I keep telling myself there's a lot to live for and that I'm too young to know the cool things in life, that is what helps me hold on. My parents took away my devices after I fought with my mom. I don't even know what we fought about but she said I shouldn't say things in the heat of the moment or she could even call the police and they take me to a mental facility. I told her I don't care. I told her I genuinely don't care if she wanted to hit me or beat me and I meant it a little, in fact, it's like I want someone to hit me right now just to feel something. I'm on an old phone right now which I hope they don't find. I want to be able to swim and I want to be strong but it's not easy to not be self-destructive. My parents keep telling me in life there are things you have to do that you don't want to do. No shit but this feels like telling a homeless person not to be homeless. I know a lot of this I'm in the wrong and my parents aren't bad people but I feel like everyone around me doesn't know how to live in other people's shoes.",

I know my best friend hates when I drink so I try not to so he doesn’t feel upset about it. and self harm i guess but i have to stay clean for summer and it just makes me more miserable.\n\nright now he just texted me that he didn’t even notice i left the game server I was playing with him in before I wrote this. i really wish it’d be the same way if i just died altogether.",

I tried to continue a long-distance relationship with her, but a few weeks later I ended that too.\n\nI still feel guilty, though. The only reason she had been able to afford the apartment we'd been living in is because we shared the cost. When I left, she had to move in with her neglectful, emotionally abusive father. Her father and late step-mom's neglect and emotional abuse, plus her mother's death in early childhood were the source of all of her mental health problems. And I threw her back in because I just couldn't handle it anymore.\n\nIt's been a year now. I'm still recovering, to be honest. I experienced autistic burnout from that relationship and the jobs I worked while living with her. I spent months living with my dad, barely leaving my room, trying to recharge from three years being in another person's presence for virtually 24 hours a day. I've moved in with my mom now. I've recovered enough that I crave social interaction again. I hang out with my family. I even made a new friend! We met online and then met up in person. We live in different cities, and they have their own mental and physical health problems, so we don't get to meet up often. They're autistic too! They understand me in a way no one ever has before. And being friends with them has shown me what it's like to care about someone with mental health issues without them using me as a crutch.\n\nThere isn't really a conclusion to this story. I'm still dealing with the consequences of that relationship. Hell, I've got other shit going on in my life that's messing me up as well. (And that's a whole separate post, lol.)\n\nI just... fuck. I guess this relationship made me realize that people can hurt you profoundly without an ounce of malice behind it. She loved me deeply. I know she never wanted to hurt me. But she did. She hurt me *by* loving me.\n\nIt feels a bit like I've lost something, one of the kinder, more childlike parts of myself, with the knowledge that love can wound just as easily as hate.",

Unfortunately working in a female-dominated environment is a nightmare. I didn’t realize how two-faced so many of them are. And when I came to the realization, the crash was hard.\n\nI am on the spectrum. I have mild autism and severe anxiety.\n\nI know I’m odd. And unfortunately when you’re a girl that’s neurodivergent, other girls can easily make out that you’re odd. They scope you out as soon as you walk into the room. It’s like they have some sort of neurodivergent detector and are able to immediately know when you’re not ‘normal,’ or I mean- that’s been my experience working here.\n\nI know that there are a few girls that don’t like me simply because of that reason. They’ll be incredibly dismissive, I’ll try to make conversation and they’ll talk to me in a way that makes me feel like I’m dumb or a nuisance. I always got that vibe from them.\n\nIt wasn’t until today that something in my gut told me to start recording conversations in the breakroom while I went to do my services.\n\nI put my camera on record, set my phone down and walked out of the room. Two of the girls in it.\n\nI proceed to do my service. After 8 minutes I come back, grab my phone, step outside and plug my earbuds in. And there it is.\n\n“Ugh she’s so annoying and loud, she tried to talk to me today about so and so.”\n\n“ugh can’t she see that I’m on my phone! I don’t wanna talk to you can’t you get the memo.”\n\n“She’s a little….”\n\n“Yeah she is that’s why I left the room immediately.”\n\n“She stresses me out.”\n\nIt hurt. One of the ladies taking about me was someone that I supported while she was grieving. The other one I never spoke to in a degrading manner.\nI never talked growing up because I was always shut down by the people around me. I try my best to talk to people and make conversation because it’s just a comfort thing.\nI understand if they don’t wanna have a conversation with me, but instead of calling me annoying and loud, I wish they could’ve just set that boundary with me. I wouldn’t have minded. I’m autistic for god-sakes I can’t understand social cues! It’s a daily fight trying to understand the simplest of things but I just cannot.\nI told my manager. I sent her the video. I feel guilty for what’s to come but it hurt. Not only did they say horrid things about me, but I noticed that they have also said degrading things about the new employees we have on board.\nI’m in bed right now and I haven’t felt this alone in a very long time. The last time I had self harm ideations was around 2021. But I can feel them bubbling back up because of this situation.\nI’m okay right now. My sister is my rock through this but I can feel myself cracking. I just needed to get this off my chest. Thank you.",

My mental health has never been great, but I've always managed to get by, albeit with unhealthy coping mechanisms. A series of events at work last year just pushed me too far though, I couldn't carry on.\n\nYou know what, I don't need to go into the details of what happened or the journey I've been on. I just need to have a rant about the appalling state of mental health care. So here are some highlights.\n\n- a GP telling me I don't need a doctor, just go home and pray\n\n- a therapist asking how I am after we had a (not planned) 6 week gap between appointments...when I described how my self harm behaviours had escalated, she cut me off with \"well we're not here to talk about that\"\n\n- an occupational health doctor saying it sounded like I have PTSD caused by work and that he doesn't see how I can return to that role...but then refusing to put anything in his report to my employer that would enable a redeployment process, only saying that I'm not currently fit to work\n\n- finally got a GP referral to mental health services (took 9 months...then another 2 for an appointment). Meeting with psychiatrist was difficult, but it ended with them saying they were going to refer me to a psychologist. I thought I was finally getting help...but today, 3 weeks later, I received a copy of their report and it says no further support required from mental health services and that I am discharged.\n\nI'm doing better this evening, no need for a welfare report, but after reading that I just wanted to end it. How am I supposed to get better without support? I can't go back to the same job, but I can't afford to stay off work much longer (I recognise I'm very privileged to have been able to stay off this long!)\n\nI feel trapped with no way out and no one offering help.",

        "Post Text": "TW: Contains mentions of unattempted suicide and self harm.\n\nI (18) met my previous online best friend (17) around six years ago. Avery and I were extremely close. I want to be very clear that I am confident that they loved me, just as I loved them. I don't think they ever wanted to cause me any pain or harm. They were there for me when others weren't, and I won't go into detail, but they helped me get through a lot of mental health struggles. At the same time, they were struggling a lot with their own mental health. Here's the key difference: I spiraled first, and, eventually, it was discovered by the people in my life due to the danger I was in. My parents can afford it, so I was put into treatment. I got better, and I am doing much better now. That wasn't the case for Avery. This is important later.\n\nAnother thing to note: Avery had SEVERE abandonment issues. Throughout the course of our friendship, I probably promised them thousands of times that I would never leave them. Sad, right? Over the years, our relationship started to change. Avery was extremely reliant on me and my friendship. Around a year and a half before I left, these are the things that were most prominent. First, I could not go a full day without messaging them or they would freak out. I felt obligated to spend a considerable amount of time each day texting them. Second, they would often vent to me and ask me for solutions to their problems. They stopped asking how I was doing, but I didn't notice because I wanted nothing more than to help them. In addition, the venting came out of nowhere. The topic of their venting was often about how great my life was in comparison to theirs. Sometimes, it would be about how they felt guilty for thinking that when I was so stressed about school and college. Third, it was like they worshipped the ground I walked on. They looked up to me like a role model, a therapist, and a best friend all in one.\n\nThose are the main things. Now, a quick rundown of some specific events that ultimately led to our downfall. Over the summer, a year before the end, I went on a very nice camp for two and a half weeks. Leading up to it, Avery began to freak out. They didn't think they could make it without me (the camp was device free). I felt HORRIBLE for going, but I also felt like there was nothing I could do. I told them that my parents spent a lot of money, so I didn't have a choice. I think in reality, I just, honestly, wanted to go. That felt like a crime, though, because I was leaving them. I ended up coming up with this solution: I sent them a long message before I left that contained a message for every day that I was gone. When I got back, I found out that they had gone to the hospital for a severe self harm incident. Their family could not afford the care they needed.\n\nThen, just a month apart, Avery's father AND cat died. And all those issues I mentioned got so, so much worse. Months later, I planned another summer camp similar to the first. I felt genuinely afraid to tell Avery about it, and I put it off as long as I could. I didn't want to feel guilty for having fun or for living my life. When I finally told them, the fighting became a constant. If I ever tried to bring up the issues I mentioned, they would shut down. They'd talk about how they were a horrible person and how they didn't deserve me, so I couldn't ever talk to them about the issues.\n\nRight before I left, it all came to a head. We got together in a group chat with Avery's girlfriend, and tried to talk it out. During this final discussion, many things were said. It broke me. Among other things, they told me that their hospital visit the previous summer was my fault. That it was because I went away. They also said \"your life is my dream,\" \"I'm fucking nothing worth celebrating,\" and \"none of this shit is valid right?\" (BIG TW) They also said that the next day, they would need to strap themself down to not commit suicide. I left the group chat after that and proceeded to have a panic attack. I thought I would message when I got back from camp, and we'd figure it out. Instead, I ghosted them. I felt like such a coward, but I couldn't bring myself to face them. During that time, they tried many things to get me to respond. One of those things was threatening suicide. I thought they were serious, so I called the police, and they did a wellness check. Avery was furious, obviously.\n\nThen, finally, after several weeks, I sent them one last message. I didn't tell them the specifics. I didn't want to hurt them more than I thought I had to. Their responses were... Far from happy. Some quotes: \"I hate you so so so so much. But yet I love you.\" \"You traitor, liar, and backstabber.\" \"You were ready to destroy not only me, but everything we've built.\" \"I'm sorry I clearly wasn't worth it to you.\" Those quotes were from the final stage. The anger. Before that, it was begging. Telling me they can't do it without me. Around the same time, Jackie broke up with Avery.\n\nI kept in touch with Jackie. From what I gathered, she recieved a less severe version of what I experienced, so she understood. A few days ago, I found out that they got back together. Jackie pushed me to give Avery 30 minutes so that they could get closure. Idiotically, I agreed. To give you an idea of how it went, I once asked, \"Is this helping you because it is hurting me?\" To which they responded \"maybe,\" before moving on. I was told that I essentially brainwashed Jackie into believing that our experiences were bad.\n\nI guess I needed to tell someone this. Someone unbiased. I need to know if I'm a horrible person. Please keep in mind that Avery and I, through all that, still had good moments. I feel like I'm mourning, but I have no right to.",

        "Post Text": "I've been clean from SH for about 2 years and recently started again. I told one of my boyfriends (3 months, referred to as M from here on) but I can't bring myself to tell my other boyfriend. (3-ish years, referred to as Y from here on) (before anyone brings up cheating, I'm polyamorous, but this is not related to the post) I've also been partially keeping the truth from M, I told him it was a one time thing, and he said that I should just not worry about this slip up. He told me to not count it, to just subtract a day from the count in terms of how long I've been clean, but that doesn't make sense. I haven't at all told Y that I'm struggling and M & Y don't usually talk without me present so there's virtually no way Y knows. Y has seen me at my darkest point, he's seen me lose 60lbs from an eating disorder, and he's stuck with me through recovering from that alongside my self harm. He also used to self harm but does not anymore. I don't want to cause him more pain. Neither of them deserves such a nuisance like myself.\n\nThe thing that kept me from relapsing mostly was the idea that I was \"pretty\" otherwise, and that scars or open wounds would be unattractive. I was right, but I can't find it in me to care. I'm fat and ugly and transgender, honestly if it weren't for the fact that I'm finally moving away from my abusive mother I would just kill myself. Optimism be damned, lol. This all sounds like the rambling of a very vain person but honestly I'm not. I lost a lot of self-confidence relatively recently (and in retrospect that's probably a catalyst for my relapse,) due to some comments made on my body by a \"friend\" and my mother. I can't really blame them, it's not their job to walk on eggshells around me, I just wish they weren't telling me to relapse into my eating disorder.\n\nAside from it all, everything feels like it's being forced on me by everyone else. I turned 18 exactly 2 months before this post, and since then nothing's been my choice. I was forced to take a course upgrade, (which is so stressful and I'd call it the primary reason for me relapsing, even if it's really a combination of causes) forced to stay home for the whole summer, forced to save up any and all gift money I got from graduation, (even the stuff that was just slipped to me away from my mother as a present, (which she also took without asking, to be fair, she did repay it, and if she had asked I would've loaned it to her, but it's the principle of it.)) I've been told that if I contact a helpline I'll be disowned (which doesn't really matter because I'm moving out but I need a home for right now, so I'd rather *not* do that.) and (rather marginally, to be frank,) aside from all of that, my boyfriends have both told me that they prefer me at the weight I'm at, which makes me feel like I have even less control of the situation. Honestly, I feel like relapsing into my eating disorder would make me feel better but unfortunately I value their opinions more than my own, and besides they're probably right, it probably *is* better to stay recovered. I just want to have some sort of freedom, and that also probably plays a factor in it all.\n\nI don't even know why I'm posting here. No matter what I do I know I'm just going to be told it's all my fault anyway, and no amount of blaming everyone but me will make me stop cutting. No amount of care and concern will either, and I don't know what to do. I feel trapped.",

I know this, yet I still wait. like an idiot.\n\nmaybe you did ruin me. and that's not your fault. but even as I type this out I secretly hope you'll find this and ignore the weirdness of it and try to make things work. you told me you wouldn't, and I need to get that through my skull. part of me thinks back to that greek myth of athena, how zeus took a hammer to the skull and she sprung forth. maybe something beautiful will spring from this. maybe the relief of my bone crumbling and the explosion of my brain will cause something so much better. but maybes are the station I'm currently stuck at.\n\nI know I'll never get the answer to this, but I wonder why you couldn't love me. why you couldn't try. maybe the answer is something that would hurt even more. I'm not sure what is worse; the idea that none of it mattered, or it did matter and I wasn't worth it. either way, I think I'll love you forever.\n\nthis isn't only just a scream into the void, but I'm also letting you know that I'm relinquishing you. I can't keep ducking back under the waves in hopes of being washed back out to sea. if I were to again, I'd need an invitation. I hate overstaying a welcome.\n\nI love you. please take care of yourself. you know I'll always be here for you, but even if it's friendship, I need something more.",

I’d usually cry and scream for my parent, as I was scared. My heart would feel like it was beating out of its chest. I’m pretty sure I’d fall asleep after it stopped. (My memory around the experience is mostly forgotten)\n\nOne of the things I remember, was when I had woken up in the middle of the night, I think my arm felt uncomfortable? When I turned on the lights, all over my arm, were tons of fresh cuts. I don’t want to get into too much detail, but the cuts covered my whole inner forearm, from my wrists to the bend of my arm. I knew they were fresh because I’d never seen those before, and they were slightly reddened around each cut. I hadn’t cut before, or even thought about harming myself at the time.\n\nBut the evidence was there: it had to have been me. I wasn’t a heavy sleeper.\n\nThis memory is one that’s always bothered me. How I could do something like that, and completely not remember. Could I have blocked it out at that moment? I couldn’t have done it while sleeping.",

Well 3 weeks ago I tried failed and scheduled a dinner with a female friend just for some conversational comfort with a pretty girl. Well while the date approached I felt not suicidal for the first time in a long time. A girl came in to work and gave me her number without asking. We went for fucking coffee… Coffee… I learned her past was the sale as mine for abuse PTSD and depression. Shes 20. Supports her family on minimum wage. She was also a never been kissed virgin. 3 days after we met we started making love and have only stopped recently nearly two weeks later. My wife seemed happy for me even saying congratulations… I said nothing to her but she knew. People act different. My poor girlfriend doesn’t 100% know about my wife. I couldn’t bear to tell her as shes recovering from a self harm episode. I want to. Ive given her a big outline. But thats not all… she might have gotten pregnant probably not we figure now but only time will tell. She now has corona and …. Jesus this is so fucked. Just before she was super irritable with me and IDK if shes sick of me and its over just as fast as it started or what. If it is I want to end and leave everything to my daughter.

Now Ik bpd is a complex thing with multiple symptoms but these are the most prominent ones. So I have this problem where I fall for a girl it’s always a girl for some reason we either end up dating or friends. But even if I’m in a relationship not with them I end up revolving My whole life around them, changing my personality, building up a future, and everything be for there validation. I get mad when they talk to other people, I can go from loving that person but treating them as my worse enemy for something as little as left on read and it doesn’t end till they cut me off or I find someone I like better. Yes, all these people were my favorite people but idk what blurs the line between normal crush and bpd favorite person. Other friends? I usually just feed off of others people when I’m out or I have to be high for social events but I just feel so out of place even if there my friends. My dream life would just be me and whoever I attach to start fresh somewhere. I really don’t have anger isssues but when a conflict regarding switched plans arrives I can be hell. Also it takes a long time for me to calm down a force of energy I release by cutting. Now I have a mixed relationship with myself. One hand I love myself she deserves the best and didn’t deserve nothing that as happened to her but sometimes I hate myself I wanna wake up a different person I hate the way my brains blows things out of proportion I hate being sensitive I hate being weak everything abt me.

In school they happen everyday and last only a few minutes, but when I’m home, they happen much less but are much more intense and last much longer, more than 30 minutes. When I have these thoughts I sometimes harass people in some way, but most of the time, I destroy various objects around me, or kill insects, or play with corpses I find outside. It helps me. Sometimes I kill small animals, watch gore, or try to, birds are too fast, but frogs stand no chance. I am also highly impulsive when these episodes happen. After my episode clears, I get a strong amount of regret and guilt, like clarity. Some info about my mental health that may relate to this are: history of self harm, hybrid ADHD, severe burnout, depression.

Well I’ve stopped SH in the “usual way” I’ll obviously not go into detail but I keep doing things that I know will end up hurting me or making me sick. I’ve only really thought of it as self harm recently and it’s frustrating because I don’t cut anymore last time was December and the time before that was probably April 2023. But instead I just do stupid things.\n\nLike today for example. I have inappropriate tachycardia (fast heart for no reason). I have drank energy drinks even though I know it’s gonna cause a problem. And now my heart's freaking out and now my heart rate is 130bpm sat down. On top of that, I had a bit of a health crisis last night thinking there was something in my ear and now I’ve hurt my ear so bad I can’t hear out of it. I was gonna book an appointment at the doctors to get it checked but then I decided I’d just leave it so it can get worse. Like I actively chose to leave it. Because I want it to hurt? I often get sick and I often leave it so I can suffer and then only go to the doctors when it interferes with other people or they notice so I do the “oh yeah I’m calling the doctor tomorrow” and they just accept it because it’s not something most people would do to themselves. I guess.\n\nAfter thinking I know I need help with it. I don’t know what exactly “it” is but I’m also not sure I want help. I’m not really sure if it’s even a real issue or if I’m just making it up. Idk. I’ve told my mental health worker about it before but I think she’s forgotten so I keep getting away with it. Which is great at the time but I know realistically it’s pretty bad.

        "Post Text": "Hi so a bit of context is needed for this post. A couple years ago I went through a depressive period where I just felt down all the time and didn’t really speak about it with many people, the depressive thoughts got bad and I began SH where I would cut my wrists several times up my whole forearm, I only began stopping this when my Dad saw the marks one day and spoke to me about it after school, now I didn’t stop because of the support it gave me, I stopped because I felt embarrassed and ashamed of self harming and now every time I see the scars I feel the same shame and embarrassment because of how much it hurt my Dad knowing that I didn’t talk to him about my mental health and how bad it had got. After stopping self harming a couple months went by and I started feeling better and since then I have been fine with my emotions pretty much levelled out not feeling overly down or having major highs just somewhere in the middle.\n\nRecently however me and my girlfriend of 2 and a bit years went through a rough patch and I ended it with her which looking back on we both needed but neither of us wanted to make the decision, it wasn’t a clean breakup but it didn’t have too bad of an effect on me. That was 4 months ago and the first couple of months I was completely normal obviously slightly heart broken but mostly fine, in the last month maybe two I’ve been having just random waves of sadness for no particular reason. I don’t think it’s linked to the breakup because there is no particular reason I feel sad but I feel as bad as I did in my depressive episode a couple years ago but instead of just feeling down I have times where I feel amazing and times where I feel awful and a little lonely. Now I’ve not started self harming because it’s not something I ever want to do again and I’m going to do everything I can to prevent myself from SH again.\n\nBut anyway I just wanted to know if it sounds like I’m in another depressive episode or just experiencing normal emotion because I had a difficult childhood with emotional and some physical abuse so I’m not entirely sure what normal is. My Dad suffered from depression but is on medication and I attempted to go that route but was too young. I’m not neurotypical and have strong autistic and ADHD tendencies so idk if that impacts anything. I’ve been working kids as I’ve just finished college so I’m doing 40 hour or more weeks which is fine by me because I enjoy having something to do. I’ve also been going to the gym since the breakup and I love it and the gym makes me feel amazing especially with the confidence in my body but yeah that should be all the context needed obviously if any more information is needed I’ll add it but yeah i just need some advice or guidance or something.",

I already tried talking to her with every argument in the book about why she should live on. Myself, our dog, her family, her potential, anything I could think of. She seems really relaxed talking about it and has a very specific idea in mind. She talks about it and says it's relieving and I don't know what to even do anymore to help her. I know I have a few days at least, but I need any ideas or support I can get to see if I can help her. She regularly sees a therapist, has had EXTREMELY traumatic experiences with mental health facilities and says if I call one or her therapist she will do everything she can to kill herself either immediately or during/after the inpatient experience.

Does anyone else do this or is it just my scrambled brain? Would it be considered self harm? How do I stop? I'll try to explain it using today as an example. I've been wanting to shower since Friday. I've been thinking about it, looking forward to finally feeling clean again and even finding motivation inside me to do it (not normal - I hate having to shower). It's Monday and I still haven't showered. Every time I want to, my brain tells me \"you're not allowed to shower until you've done xyz\". It's like I physically can't walk into the bathroom and have a shower before I've earned the right to do so by being useful and productive. I do this with eating, too. I haven't eaten all day, because I haven't finished cleaning the bathroom yet. Once the bathroom is clean, I'm allowed to have a shower and eat something. I also go for days without sleeping sometimes or fall asleep on accident, because I'm not allowed to sleep before I haven't checked all the to dos on my list. Sometimes it's like a never ending cycle where my brain comes up with a task that is really time consuming and once I've completed it, I'm still not allowed to eat or shower or sleep because \"now that you're at it, you can do xyz as well. if you give yourself a reward now, you won't get anything done after it\". I hate it. It's not fair that I have to earn the right to meet my body's needs or do anything I want to do by being productive. Also, it's stupid, I'm way more motivated to get stuff done when I don't feel disgusting, hungry, and tired. But my brain just doesn't stop yelling \"get over it, you gotta do what you have to first, then you've earned the right to do what you want to\" and makes me feel selfish and lazy for having needs. I'm stuck in this cycle of doing what my brain says, realizing it and trying to listen to my needs, then feeling worthless and ashamed because I did something for myself instead of doing something useful, doing what my breain says again and so on.

I'm worried it's just a false memory, and that I've been spiraling into crazy town for a while, and just wanted to put the thought out there. I don't know if this is real, or just my brain finally cracking into a billion pieces as I go completely off the deep end. I'm on a lot of (self-medicated) downers and am aware that this could be completely bullshit. I could be hallucinating the whole thing. But I don't think I am, we'll see how I feel in the morning. Trigger Warning past this point for above mentioned. I think some adult male figure in my life sexually assaulted me and my mom directly led the cover-up effort. I've had a lot of rage at my mom for some time, and can't exactly recall what the source was. I also remember my mom always treating me differently, as if there was something that happened that goes unsaid. I have specific memories of the events happening, like first-person-view memories, and I would be surprised if false memories could be this vivid. On the other hand, I am *deeply* inebriated. If nothing else, I'll read this in the morning while sober. I'll see what sober freshly-slept morning me thinks of this. If this is the final spiral into crazy town, it's been nice knowing you all! Not a self-harm joke! Just a joke about becoming a *completely* delusional nutcase. Putting this note out on Reddit seems like an idea best avoided. But I want to force myself to confront this in the morning- as my sober self- and see if this is why we're seeking comfort. It either happened, or I'm insane.",

        "Post Text": "Started self-harming at 13, never made it one entire year clean since then. I have PTSD from multiple traumatic events starting in childhood and following me into adulthood. Was in foster care, was always being taken away from people I’d grow attached to which created major attachment issues (will get back to that), experienced and witnessed so much abuse, was sexually assaulted in high school by someone I thought was a friend, my adoptive father had a workplace accident which led him into a life of abusing opioids and narcotics, putting me in danger multiple times driving me to school high or getting violent while high. Because of my upbringing, I unwittingly perpetuated a lot of trauma into my adulthood. I would pick partners who were not good matches and experience more abuse, physically and sexually, even getting assaulted by someone who claimed to love me and live with me for three years which ended in me getting an abortion which broke my heart. I self-harmed a lot in college and it led me to dropping out. The last four years I’ve been in and out of bad relationships that I genuinely convinced myself were good every time, even though I was in therapy and on meds. I landed a decent job for not having a degree and managed my own apartment and bills and car payment for years. I was treading water and very depressed but managing. Then, last summer, an ex-partner came back into my life and my attachment issues went crazy. I did not trust my judgment and I took him back, just so excited someone “came back for me.” He essentially moved himself in and soon after quit his job and started drinking and abusing me. He ended up getting arrested from my house and because I worked a job where I was often subjected to little kids hitting me, I stopped going to work and began calling in often as my brain felt on fire. I couldn’t distinguish the kids at work hitting me (high needs kids with autism), and my ex. I went into a total ptsd shut down state. Stopped eating, stopped showing up for work, stopped calling friends. I was frozen in my trauma apartment. I ended up moving to a city with a family member to get a fresh start. My therapist recommended I try to get an emotional support animal to help me transition and cope with leaving my apartment and friends behind in my old state. but being the idiot I am, I ended up getting a stray off the streets because I felt so sorry for him. I wasn’t really in the market for a dog, he just kept visiting me on the porch and I have a big guilt complex. Flash forward a few months and in the new city I’m living in, trauma finds a way to haunt me again. I was a witness to an act of mass gun violence with multiple casualties. I was very shaken up obviously but still trying to pull through. Out of nowhere my dog (idk if he picks up on my vibes or what) started to become very reactive. He’d lunge at other dogs on walks, bark his head off, growl at me when I touched his toys. I spent over 2 grand trying to train him and he ended up becoming a powder keg waiting to explode and I became wary of him. I then moved in with my parents, I admitted to everyone I needed more help and on top of everything my dog was making things harder. My parents promised to help me and support me and were thrilled that I was coming back home. However, as soon as I made the 14 hour move, only two weeks after I got there my parents made me rehome my dog. I didn’t have anywhere else to go and I was burnt out on moving. Part of me is glad the stress of having a dog has subsided, but my heart aches with guilt and grief over getting rid of him. Like I feel sick every time I think about it, wondering if he’s being treated well by someone who can handle him, wondering if he misses me. Other problem is I’m uninsured in my new state and no longer have therapy. I wasn’t on meds but don’t have access to get any right now anyways. My parents also have gone on vacation—I shit you not—every single weekend since I’ve been here for the last three months. And when I’m here, they do very little to actually support me, too preoccupied with being retirees with big social and financial plans to shop till they drop. I have no friends here but reconnected with a guy I went to high school with and went on some dates. He’s a graphic designer now and as I like to make art myself, we hit it off and began dating. The only problem is I hate it here and I’m so depressed and the idea of being such a miserable sack around him has me terrified that I’m not a good partner for him. He seems to like me a lot and has shown great means of support, more than my parents, but it still feels terrible. I told him I’d really like to move back to my original state and he said he’d do long distance or even come with me one day. That takes a lot of time and effort and I have very little money right now and no job, so I have to be patient here until I can move back. I hate this state more than anything, I hate my mindset and the position I’m in and everything about my life right now. I hate it all and no matter what I do to try and change anything, it’s all a waiting game and each day I wake up feeling lower and lower. I’m completely burnt out, exhausted, sad and tired all the time. I don’t know what to do or where to start. I tried to get insurance but was denied for state, and it feels impossible to find a job offering any insurance with no degree where I am. I also can’t stand the idea of living here even another day, so the patience aspect feels like it’s consuming me alive. I feel so stuck and rock bottom I don’t know how to keep on going. Now that I don’t have my dog or friends or anything, I just sit in my room all day and make art I’m not proud of (uninspired) and vent to my boyfriend, slowly becoming a toxic girlfriend. We go on dates and he lets me sleep over often but it’s actually really hard right now to do that stuff because as SOON as I leave, I feel sad. I know that’s codependent but I really like this guy and the idea that it could be right person wrong time destroys me, knowing how much work I’ve already tried to do on myself. I try to talk to my friends back home, I have many, but it just hurts so badly knowing how much I miss them. I feel like my entire life has imploded, like I single-handedly ruined my entire life for good. Like I can’t think my way out of the hole that I’m in so deep.",

        "Post Text": "I'm a 13yo female and I am currently in a relatively big friend group at school. Three of the girls in my friend group scar themselves (at school and at home). One of the girls has said something about slowly becoming suicidal. She is a year older than me and everyone knows about it. Yesterday one of the girls who sh (let’s call her Jane) showed me her arm that had a bunch of scars on it (she did it with a razor). I told Jane she should talk to the guidance counselor/school psychologist. She laughed and said no. Today Jane came up to me and one of the other girls who doesn’t sh. She asked us for a pencil sharpener to hurt herself. I said no. I told Shelley to say no. Jane said that the longer she waits the worse she feels. I still said no (I don’t know if that was the right thing to do). I just didn’t want her to hurt herself. She went up to the rest of the friend group. One girl (fake name is Mary) gave her the singular sharp part of the razor. (Mary self-harms as well). But I did not know that Mary gave Jane the razor. I walk down to the oval with the girl I was sitting with. When I came up to where we were eating Jane yelled at me to get my attention and showed me her bleeding arm. I went over to the friend group and asked who gave the razor to Jane. Mary said she did. I was quite angry because at that point I didn’t understand why Mary would let Jane sh. I asked her why she would do it and she said she does it too. No one cared. They just sat there and watched her cut herself. I told Jane once again that she needs to talk to someone and she laughed and said no again. I walked away and finished my lunch and tried to think about what I should do. I’m really worried because I don’t know what to do in this situation. I’m also really guilty because I’m worried I’m not being emotionally supportive enough. I understand it’s not okay and she needs help but I don’t know what to do. I thought about telling the school but I’m not sure about what they would do. I want to make sure that whatever they do to help will make her feel better and not worse. I have read other posts and about the topic and one said to not tell the school as schools can be unpredictable in their approach to deal with these things. I also don’t know how to give her the adequate support. I’m not really good when people tell me about their private lives. I don’t know what to say and do. I don’t know anyone’s parents in the group. There is this one teacher that everyone likes and is very trustworthy. I don’t think he knows Jane but either way I’m sure he would know what to do. I’m sure if he didn’t think the school would have the right approach he would fix the problem privately and possibly tell the school psychologist. Apart from the teacher and the school, I don’t think there is any other people for me to tell. As I said before I don’t know anyone’s parents. Please help me out.",

        "Post Text": "Please lmk if there's a better place for me to post this! long post content warning: mention of self harm, suicidal ideation, rape, substance use. Why do I miss feeling depressed or overwhelmed/anxious? Why am I almost... jealous... of other people's stressful situations or trauma? Why is feeling content almost... boring? So, context. I'm in my late 20s, POC, queer, living in a big US city where it feels comfortable to be both of those things, single and enjoying that, working at a relatively mellow food service job, with coworkers I enjoy spending time with at and outside of work. I have a few close friends and a couple hobbies I'm currently building community within. My rent is relatively cheap, and I love my roommates and home. Life is really good for me right now. And just in the past few days, some of my friends/acquaintances have been Going Through It. One of them is going through a breakup, one of them is moving in with a parent soon to take care of them because they have a terminal illness, and one of them had to go to their hometown to tend to their last living parent who is ill due to long-term substance use. This last one particularly weighs heavy on my heart, because this person is in their early 20s, has a great head on their shoulders, and is building the life they want for themself, despite some of the abuse/neglect in their childhood (at least, this is what I've gathered from what they've mentioned to me). And you know, it's great that I currently have the capacity to care for and support my friends at this time. I love them. However. In the back of my head, there's a part of me that feels almost jealous. Or maybe guilty, for feeling okay right now? I'm not exactly sure how to describe it. I feel tempted to seek out situations that might cause me distress or pain, but I feel this urge pretty passively. So I'm not actually seeking it out, but considering it. Almost out of boredom. I think I'm attracted to intensity. I suspect I experienced emotional neglect as a child (neither of my parents were really affectionate or emotionally available), and I have a fear of abandonment that comes out in romantic relationships, because of this and my parents being divorced. In the past, I've had periods of time when I felt so depressed or anxious I'd be dissociating pretty consistently for months at a time. I used to self harm and have suicidal ideation. When I first started having sex, among the fun times, I put myself in a situation I knew was not a good idea, and I still don't exactly know why. This was when I was discovering the kinky part of myself, so it included bondage. I was raped, and the act itself felt frustrating, but strangely did not feel traumatic to me. I still engage with BDSM, but more carefully these days (BDSM teaches one a lot about boundaries, consent, self-advocation, trust). My fear of abandonment actually feels more traumatic to me. I had an anxious attachment style in my previous relationship, so I truly got triggered sometimes and would shake and cry uncontrollably from perceived abandonment. It was really codependent, so I basically ended up neglecting myself until I got to a breaking point. The lead-up to that breaking point was maybe the most emotionally difficult times of my life, and at the breaking point I was back at a point of suicidal ideation. In addition to shaking and crying, I'd scream, throw things, I started using drugs that were once recreational, to numb the feelings. I think I sometimes miss the intensity of crying all the time and feeling out of control. And yes, I do meekly seek out BDSM for these feelings, but I imagine it's not the same as feeling distress from a situation that's truly out of your control (in BDSM, because I consent to something, the situation IS in my control). I do still use drugs, recreationally again (it's a way that works for me, I'm big on harm reduction, I don't want to get to a point where I can't pay my bills), but I almost miss... not caring about my well-being. I met someone recently, and started doing drugs with them simply because I felt like being around them would eventually land me in a Not Good situation (they don't have a great reputation). I actually haven't seen them in a few weeks because there was a situation with another friend that made us suspicious, and I now want to confront this person about it. The point is though, that being around them felt like an easy way to passively seek out eventual pain, and that's why I was attracted to this person. I'm just trying to understand myself. I don't know what I truly want. Do I REALLY want to feel Not Good? Am I just afraid of feeling content? Do I feel guilty for feeling content? I don't think I feel bad for feeling content/happy. It's more that I MISS feeling unhappy, sometimes.",

I moved away to the United States and she went to a different city for University. I came back this summer for vacation and we spent a few days together last week before she went back to school. I could tell she was feeling down. She has lost a lot of weight since I saw her. I noticed she developed an ED and tried my best to make her eat more. Yesterday I went on Snapchat and saw her story she made about her healing journey from depression. Turns out, she's been extremely depressed and self harming. According to her this is not the first attempt but the 32nd. As I was scrolling through I felt like a failure for not recognizing the obvious signs. And at the end of her story she said she relapsed again and goodbye for the last time. She sent me a snap of her arm attached to an IV (I saw this before her Snapchat story) I called her several times she didn't pick up. She just replied to me that she's hospitalized for attempt and that she'll call me later. I have no idea what to say to her to help her. We are separated by cities and I don't think her parents know about it. I'm scared to tell them because it will feel like I'm breaking her trust and sharing something she doesn't want to share. I understand her a little since I had multiple suicidal thoughts myself but never had the courage to go through with it. I genuinely don't know what to do and this whole thing made me so depressed. Please help!!",

People in my school made theories about me after I got suspended for the rest of that year. After several weeks everybody basically agreed on a reason which was that I abused a girl and now everyone thinks it's a fact. I have been dealing with mental health problems which led to my suspension and nobody knows the truth. I'm just worried about how it's going to affect me, even with my other problem colliding. I'm worried about not being able to make new friends (because my old ones left) and trying to find someone. It's so much that this could affect. In previous things that tie into this was about a girl. Me and this girl were friends. She knew I liked her. She was the first person who truly cared about me. She helped me through my suicide issues and my self-harm. She liked everything I liked. I thought she was perfect. At the beginning of the year, I called her out for talking behind my back, she was kind of sad. Throughout the year we went from being friends back to me calling her out on shit the whole year. Once it ended she talked to me, asked me how I feel if she hurt herself (she dealt with suicide too). I was taken aback by it. Then she told me she liked me before I called her out. All the stuff she supposedly said was fake. Her friend then falsely reported that I was stalking her. I got suspended even though there was no proof. People say it's stupid that I can't stop thinking about her. I truly liked her and she was the first to care about me and now I messed up. I can't stop thinking about her and what we could have been. Along with me being worried about next year.",

        "Post Text": "Hi, on alt. I'm 21. When I was 15 I had 4 friends attempt suicide within a year, and then when I was 17 I witnessed a friend's intentional overdose when I received a goodbye text from them at 3 am. I stayed on call and texted him until he was unresponsive because we were long-distance friends and I couldn't do anything else to help. One friend attempted after a fight we had, another attempted after we broke up. Neither were really my fault but I thought that for a long time. I've had friends and partners talk to me extensively about their self-harm, trauma, or suicidal ideation. This past year I helped my friend get a ride from our campus police to the local mental hospital because he was actively self-harming and worried he could've done worse. He called me and I went to his dorm, his wrists still bleeding, and accompanied him to the hospital. A lot of my friends have told me that they wouldn't be alive if it weren't for me, that I saved their lives, etc. I've internalized that and struggle with codependency and with constant anticipatory grief/fear one day someone will succeed. I feel traumatized, and my therapist recognizes these events as traumatic, but I can't stop feeling guilty because nobody actually died. I'm very lucky that none of my friend's have succeeded, but I feel irrational or selfish for considering these failed attempts trauma, when they were the ones suffering, and I don't really have anything to grieve. I basically saw the friend who overdosed as already dead for a long time. My brain was trying to accept his death when it didn't even happen. I guess I just need validation. I don't feel very good tonight. If anyone can relate, or make me feel less alone, I'd appreciate it a lot.",

My career is a joke, and my current job pays horribly and it's not worth it, but I need it in order to sustain my household. Looking for a job feels like a chore and getting constantly rejected is frustrating. Having to take care of my household (my mother + our pets + our house expenses + food) is something I don't think I can do anymore. My partner insists on me moving out, but I have conflicting emotions about it since I do want to leave but I would be basically sending my mother to insanity by doing so and thinking about it for so long has led me to feel resentment towards both my family and my partner, which is not something I want. My sibling has also almost disappeared from my life and I have to talk to them about living expenses, but thinking about it makes me feel like it's going to be the turning point in our relationship. I don't want us to hate each other but my feelings towards them are full of resentment. I disgust myself. My own reflection makes me cringe. My partner and I entered polyamory and it's been really tough on me. They're obviously in love with one of their connections and I feel this impending feeling of abandonment, like the only logical conclusion to this will be my partner breaking up with me, spending 10x more time with their connections, just forgetting about me. I have asked for reassurance and they've given me it, they've told me numerous times that our relationship is unique and special to them, and that they will never leave me. But I can't help but feel like those are just lies. I can't help but feel replaced. Useless. I know the most obvious solution to this is setting boundaries, but I just don't know how to do it. I don't want this to hurt so much that it makes me distance myself from my partner. As for friendships, I suppose I could say I have friends, but it's mainly online. I haven't seen my IRLs in what feels like years, and I've basically lost my best friend. I feel like everybody's replaced me. I feel utterly alone. Since 2020 I have become a shell of my former self, I am no longer fluid in showing my emotions and I repress so much. I genuinely don't feel like anything I could do will help me in any meaningful way. I've contemplated self harm, I think about suicide on the daily. I quit smoking some months ago but I feel like I'm gonna go back. I don't know what to do anymore. I am lost and alone and I don't think I can do this for much longer.",

I also did not proofread this. I don’t plan on it either.\n\nHUGE TRIGGER WARNING, MENTIONS OF SELF HARM AND MILD DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIENCE. It’s kind of written like a vent because my brain has to describe properly to get my point across.\n\nContext: I’m a 16-year-old female, and I really struggle with my mental health. Recently, my mental health got scarily bad. It was already going downhill, but some school events triggered a lot of pain. I was diagnosed with ADHD (for 5 and a half years), Autism, severe generalized anxiety about 3 and a half years ago. And definitely have moderate-severe depression, and social anxiety. I’ve hated my guts for years due to bullying, which started my suicidal thoughts, but they progressively turned from, “it’d be better without me” to “I actually am suffering in this world, I can’t do living anymore there is no future for me.” I’ve always had a self-harming tendency but as a kid, it was just bruising myself (I had no intuition to know how to truly harm myself). But around early to mid-2023, I started using sharps. But I was always scared of more than just baby scratches.\n\nThat was until around late March of this year. Although I believe the peak of this episode was late April. Although looking through the recorded pictures I took (yes, I know it’s gross) they realistically aren’t deep, but I was at the point of daily self-harm. I remember the associated feelings in that moment. I just had to dig into my skin. It wasn’t a proper sharp because I was scared I’d get sent to the hospital if I needed stitches, and the fear of hurting my mother. I felt like I was batshit crazy at that point, I was getting a different type of thrill from harming myself. It was no longer just to regulate. Once I had given myself a scare in the school bathroom, cutting way deeper than I had before. It was 10 min before the end of class and I couldn’t stop the bleeding in time. It was, I don’t know how to describe it. Surreal is the only word that comes to mind. It felt out of body. I wasn’t myself and I felt crazy. No voices or hallucinations. But I felt the smiley severe mentally ill sort of thing. It might have been worsened by the antidepressant I was on (Fluoxetine). But I feel like it was just adding to an already huge fire. I started leaving that intense part of the episode in mid-late May. In the milder part of the episode, I started talking to my mom who was concerned by the daily “I really don’t want to be here anymore.” And she started acting like I was at the peak of an episode reasonable to suggest a psych ward trip. Which is weird because I survived the true peak without anyone knowing. I was emotionally triggered instantly and I couldn’t regulate.\n\nI’m mostly fine now, it’s more of a basic depressive episode throughout June and I’m starting to lift from the depressive episode now (It’s July at the time of post). The idea of self-harming as deep as I did gives me the heebie-jeebies at this point. And once you go a certain depth it doesn’t help to go any less deep. So without realizing it, I’m around a month clean now.\n\nI originally thought to describe it as a psychotic episode. But my psychologist said that means similar to a schizophrenic episode with hallucinations and delusions. I was delusional in the sense there was no true logic going through me at that point. And I know manic is a high, and I’ve been through depressive episodes (they are different). So I have no idea what to call this episode. When I searched on Google names of different mental episodes, it only came up with psychotic episodes. I’m lost and need to know what to call this episode because calling it a “mental episode” doesn’t sound right due to the intensity of it.\n\nSo do any of you know the psychological term for the episode? It’d be much easier to tell the psychologist what the episode is truly called rather than embarrass myself describing it to her.",

        "Post Text": "TW: Suicidal thoughts, self-harm\n\nHello Reddit!\n\nThis is a long story, I’m sorry, I probably just needed to vent. Skip right to the TL;DR if you aren’t interested in the context.\n\nI (13m) had an online experience that went on roughly from ages 9 to 11. It was a friendship/relationship with a girl (now 14f) who, suffice it to say, wasn’t a great influence. In this story, I’ll call her Janet.\n\nFor some context, my mom thinks Janet had bipolar disorder, anxiety, and some amount of depression. She got pretty much unlimited access to the internet at a young age, and I think that this was another factor.\n\nThe background:\n\nFor two years, Janet would pressure me into sneaking out and cutting myself, among other things. It got really bad during our fifth grade when Janet was self-harming and experiencing suicidal thoughts. She’d threaten to kill herself whenever I “broke up” with her or tried to leave. She’d tell me I’d caused her mental illnesses. I believed her because she seemed really mature and grown-up. She was also extremely clingy and would text me nonstop.\n\nThis went on for quite some time, during which I fully retreated into myself. Janet was the only good friend I had at that point, and she’d warned me away from talking to my parents as well. Most of our communication took place over text, so I began to dread texting not just her, but also my parents and classmates.\n\nOver the summer between 5th and 6th, Janet developed a mild eating disorder. We were now texting for hours every day.\n\nI was just so, so sick of things, and I decided that I was going to stop texting Janet for good. One night, around midnight, we were texting, arguing. All caps, swearing, crying, arguing. I don’t even remember what it was about, but I said “goodnight,” turned my tablet off, and lay down to sleep. In the morning, I had over thirty notifications. I ignored them and went to my grandma’s for the weekend. After six days, during which time I ghosted her (I know that this was wrong of me, but I was 11 and in a bad place), she finally told me that she was holding a knife and going to kill herself if I didn’t respond. (Thank god I was there when she texted that, or I don’t know what she’d have done.) I responded and begged her forgiveness. She accepted, and things continued much the same.\n\nSixth grade was middle school for me, and we were in the same class. I was meeting new people, studying new things, and I felt like I’d grown out of her. Especially since her new circle involved kids who were vaping, trespassing, and committing petty theft. A month in, I said goodbye, blocked her everywhere, and sent my mom screenshots. Janet showed up to school livid and yelled at me in a busy hallway. My other friends told her to quit it, and I threatened to tell her mom what she’d said. She stormed off.\n\nThe next week was icy. Janet begged, yelled, and threatened me. I sent screenshots to her mom. Things were pretty much over after that. She never tried to exact any sort of “revenge,” although I noticed that most of her friends would glare at me in the halls, and I suspected that she was spreading rumors about me. I didn’t care.\n\nFor the rest of the year, I was lonely and definitely had some depressive episodes, but it was like a weight had been lifted off of my shoulders. And Janet didn’t even kill herself! It would have been my fault if she had, but it never happened, so I’m not a killer! My parents took me to therapy, but I didn’t really click with anyone, and I was horribly guilty and anxious about the cost, so I declared myself better and resolved to move on.\n\nDuring this time, I met a girl (now 13f) who I’ll call Lucy. Not to be unkind, but Lucy was annoying. I had to use a slang dictionary aimed at Boomers to understand her. She had ADHD, and she had a crush on me. I was flattered but uninterested, and I told her so. She said that she still wanted to be friends, and I agreed. She texted me a lot. It made me feel really anxious and nauseous, and I didn’t know why. She was flirting with me despite saying she wouldn’t, and I was pretending not to notice it.\n\nMy dad got a job in a more rural area a few hours away near the end of 6th, and so I said goodbye to Lucy. I explained that I had some texting-related Anxiety, and she told me that she wouldn’t text me. She texted me anyway, and I ghosted her. She called me a “bitch,” said “your ‘anxiety’ is fake,” and told me to “go fuck yourself.” Whatever, I was over that. Last I heard, she’s living in another area now.\n\nUp until this point, I’d lived in a really liberal area. That summer I was moving to a really rural area. White people saying the N-word rural. I decided to focus solely on my grades and forget about friends. Friends only lead to trouble and heartbreak. I’d learned that lesson! I felt so mature and proud of myself too.\n\nI was really, really lonely. Random people would call me a f@ggot, a k!ke, the n-word (I’m white), and a tr@nny, unprovoked. (I suppose I “look gay,” so maybe a bit provoked.) I learned to stand up for myself though, so that was nice. But anyway, things were depressing. I was completely isolated since I still couldn’t text without feeling nauseous, and yeah. Things were bad. Then my dad lost his job and we moved back.\n\nWow, this was long, I definitely needed to vent. Anyway, I’d thought that time would fix my texting problem, but it hasn’t. I don’t know what will fix it. And I know that my “trauma” was pretty mild, especially since people don’t usually have mental health issues at my age, and it’s been a year. But I tried to text my mom the other day, and I ended up crying on the floor of my room. Everything came back.\n\nI need to text people, to keep my relationships strong, to communicate, for school, etc. That’s how people communicate in 2024. But I feel like I physically can’t right now. But it’s a skill I need to have.\n\nSo, Reddit, how do I fix myself?\n\nTL;DR, I (13m) have a trauma association with texting, but it’s a life skill I need to have. How can I fix myself?",

        "Post Text": "I don’t mean those shitty online counseling places. I genuinely need to seek real mental health treatment to find normality in my life.\n\nI won’t give my whole life story, but here are some overviews:\n\n- Extreme suicidal and homicidal urges that always changed the reason why from as young as I could remember till about 19. Got my life better at that point and it all died down to a dull mute. Self-harm, multiple overdoses, etc.\n\n- Struggle with sexual addiction. Porn, masturbating 10-20 times a day. When I turned 18 I whored myself out to men and women because of this deep urge I couldn’t quench.\n\n- Trouble focusing my whole life. Parents tried taking me to counseling but it just became a source for me to vent about the struggles I had at home. Didn’t really help me.\n\n- Struggle with sleep for most of my life. Eventually found out I had a caffeine intolerance and cut all caffeine out of my life. I got rid of my chronic fatigue, brain fog, and narcoleptic episodes and most of my insomnia.\n\n- Struggles with controlling and regulating my emotions. Especially anger. Random outbursts. Random huge bursts of anxiety that left me shaking and crying on the floor. Lately I’ve really been struggling with driving and have had multiple cases of road rage. One of which I did with my partner in the car and really scared her. I feel so bad.\n\n- My memory has made me question before if I have early onset Alzheimer’s. I don’t, but it’s so bad I’ve forgotten my own name and age, and I’ve not recognized family members. I’ve forgotten the names of my coworkers and bosses I see every day. If it isn’t written down, I forget. If it is too long since I’ve thought about something like a book, I can forget it completely. I also fear forgetting the people in my life I love like my family. I’ve had so many people slip out of my life.\n\nWhere I am right now I’ve leveled off:\n- I work a good job in sales and customer service.\n\n- I have a partner who I love and I’m planning to move in with in the next couple of months. (I wanted to settle in with living on my own for the first time, but she is in a situation where the best choice is for us to move in together immediately after being long distance for a year visiting about once a month for 3 days to a week).\n\n- I’m in decent relationship with my family but we clash on politics, have random arguments, and I keep hurting my mother emotionally.\n\nAll in all my life has been pretty good the last couple years, but I’m tired of constantly feeling like I’m on an up and down rollercoaster of motivation and stability.\n\nHere’s the issue I’ve been dealing with lately. I feel myself declining and slipping into my old ways. I just need to hold out for 3 more months before I’m on my own and I can seek psychiatric assistance or counseling assistance. I don’t have the money, or the time, or the support from family to do that right now.\n\nI need to be crushing my job so that I can be making enough money to save and to be able to transfer down to Ohio from Virginia.\n\nI feel like I’m slipping into a really bad phase and some of my delusions and my suicidal urges and my depression is slipping back in.\n\nI’m fighting as hard as I can right now and maintaining where I am, but I’m scared.\n\nIs there any short-term solutions any of you all would recommend for finding support and counseling?\n\nAlso to everyone taking the time to respond, thank you! And I also understand some of this is willpower. But I’ve used willpower my whole life and it can only go so far when there is true dysfunction going on.",

We talked for a bit, got to know each other, then I confessed to her and she said she felt the same. I felt closer with her than I've ever felt with anyone. We had an amazing relationship. My family loved her, her family loved me, I learned her native language and she said 'You've treated me better than any guy I've ever met.' Yesterday we went out and had an amazing time and everything was normal. I went to work this morning and saw that I had around 8 texts from her (not too crazy she likes to yap) and thought nothing of it until I read them. Along the lines of 'I don't think we should be all lovey-dovey, I think God's telling me something, it's not your fault, can we stay friends?' After everything we've been through together, that happened. I started self-harming again because of this, everyone's saying the same thing. I just miss when we cuddled at the movies and she called me her sweet boy. I feel like if God was telling her that I was wrong for her, He would tell me the same thing. Maybe it's a cover for another guy or to hide the fact that I did something, I don't know anymore. She was the only girl I've met that likes autistic guys. She comforted me when I had psychotic episodes, I loved her when she felt like she didn’t deserve it. And now she's gone. I don't know if I can be friends with her after all that we've been through.

I used to struggle with really bad hormonal cystic acne when I was 16-17. It was very bad back then. I was bullied everywhere I went. I got unsolicited advice and tried almost everything but I couldn’t get it better till I consulted a dermatologist and she put me on Accutane for 5 months, after which I suffered a liver problem and stopped medication. Skin got considerably better for the next 2 years. From an ugly duckling who was constantly bullied and nerd-shamed, I grew up into a capable powerful woman who finally became confident enough to pursue her acting career.\n\nIt’s 2 years into my college and my third/final year starts in 10 days. Last month I broke out terribly again, and I couldn’t go on antibiotics because of the problems it could have on my health. It ruined my almost clear skin and on my entire right cheek I have a set of hyperpigmented marks that look like the map of Africa. It is healing but the process is painfully slow and it is killing me every day. Every day I wake up and hope to see my old face but in the mirror I see a beautiful face covered in marks. I have had terrible mental breakdowns the past month. I have distressed my single parent to the very core. I have made everyone around me unhappy but I cannot help but be sad. I cannot accept myself the way I am and it is killing me inside. I screamed and attempted self-harm multiple times and my head hurts from crying every day. I just keep thinking of people judging and bullying me behind my back when I go back to college as a 3rd year ACTOR.",

But I don't want to burden him with all of this as I know it hurts him so much to see me so hurt and upset. Even though he says he's always there to listen and be there for me, and that I can always talk to him, I just feel like an awful gf to dump all of my problems and feelings on him...\n\nI have seen a therapist before and I probably should be seeing one at this moment but I just genuinely can't afford that right now. This is such a big rant and I feel so ashamed that I have come to the point that I feel so helpless that I have to ask Reddit for advice and help...\n\nI have the constant urge to hurt myself but I haven't SH in 4 years, and I'm really struggling to keep up with that streak that I am so proud of. I just feel the need to have some sort of distraction from my mind and thoughts. I've been having suicidal thoughts again as well, I haven't felt this awful in months, I'm used to having highs and lows but I just feel so so low rn and I feel like I'm further down than rock bottom, if that's even possible.\n\nIf anyone has any sort of useful advice or has some sort of experience with this sort of thing any and all input would be appreciated ❤️",

I guess it started in childhood. My parents had concerns of autism, but were dismissed because I had a higher IQ and actually read and talked sooner than normal, I just had lots of odd behaviors like sorting and counting things and obsessions with patterns. I was highly academically competitive as a child, often having jealous rivalries with fellow students that resulted in hostile relationships. It also gave me a bit of a superiority complex, believing I was smarter than most of the other kids in my class. My grades and achievements tended to back up my belief, however. I am an only child and I admit I was very spoiled by my parents, which I believe contributes to many of the issues I’m struggling with currently. I developed OCD around the age of 10, most likely because I was starting middle school and switching from private school to public. This is where the anxiety spiral began. I was absolutely fixated on being a part of the popular crowd at school, so extreme to the point of changing everything about myself, spending immense amounts of money on name brand clothing, and causing significant mental distress and difficulties with my relationships. I never really had any genuine friends through middle school—everyone was either too unpopular for me to associate with (for fear of being seen as a loser) or popular enough to increase my social standing. I had popularity down to a methodical science, counting the number of times I interacted with people each day and sorting people based on my perceived social categories. This all came crashing down in high school. I experienced a traumatic event that worsened my OCD to the point of being so mentally exhausted, I no longer cared about popularity in the way that I had used to. I had no energy to care about anything and that was the first time in my life I experienced any kind of suicidal ideation. I got on anxiety meds, and things started getting better. I still felt like something was missing, so I began researching autism. I was sort of unofficially diagnosed with autism by my pediatrician right before I started college. I thought everything was finally right. I had my answers. And then I felt like something else was missing, and my therapist believed I also had ADHD, but I’m not so sure. Here’s the more recent issues:\n\nI’ve had another OCD episode. I often feel like something is touching me and I have to remind myself over and over that no one is near me, I’m alone in a room, no one is touching me, etc. I have dealt with a lot of suicidal ideation because of it and also started self-harming for the first time and now I don’t know how to stop.",

Currently, things have just been getting worse and I’m really struggling to cope. I don’t even know where to start, it’s almost three in the morning so forgive my rambling and thank you in advance for reading my post.\n\nThe past few years of my life have been really hard for me, I’ve been dealing with depression and suicidal ideation for a while now. I lost my dad a few years back, I’ve dealt with multiple friends and their suicide attempts/ideation, I was sexually assaulted (I was 18 and had zero experience, I woke up seconds before he could actually rape me), I had an injury that has left me unable to fully use that injured part of my body, I ended a 12-year friendship recently, I watched a friend almost die, I lost a loved one a few days ago, I’ve been feeling lost academically, and then there’s just the general ‘the world sucks and there’s no hope’. All of this has led me to a dark place, I’ve started cutting myself which has left me with a scar I always have to hide. I lied about only cutting once, it felt so good that I just want to do it every time I’m upset. My relationship has been very rough the past few months which is requiring so much more energy from me which I don’t have. Everything is so difficult for me, having to do anything productive makes me want to kill myself, I genuinely don’t want to exist and deal with things. For years I’ve had the belief that nobody is capable of helping me, I deal with everything by myself. By dealing, I mean suppressing, this has not been healthy for me because that just means I keep everything bottled up. I’m at a point in my relationship where I have to face my feelings, there’s no running or else I ruin things and end up single. But I’m scared to face things because I’m scared that facing this means facing everything and I don’t know if that’s something I can deal with especially when my go-to solution is suicide. I’m really struggling to focus as well, I’m constantly elsewhere. It’s so hard for me to be present, something serious can happen (like death) and I’m off thinking of nonsense instead of allowing myself to feel, I don’t even do it on purpose, I actually try to stop it but it’s hard. I feel like a fraud for feeling emotions because I’m never fully feeling them, then when people react to me with sympathy I feel like I’m faking it and that makes me angry and makes me feel even worse. I am in therapy right now but I still feel like shit. I wish I could just go to a mental health facility for a few months and recover but I don’t have time for that because I’m currently doing my masters and doing a completely separate additional academic course. Everything feels like too much and I don’t have an outlet, cutting is the only thing that made me feel better. When I can’t cut I feel like pinching myself until I bleed. I feel like a big ball of energy that’s ready to explode, cutting was such a good release for me in that regard but I know that’s a slippery slope. Lately, I’ve been feeling more reckless and not caring about my life. I feel like I can easily slip into dangerous things, eating disorders, drugs, more intense self-harm, etc. I’m heading in the direction where I am struggling to care about my well-being. My boyfriend tries to help the best he can but we’re both just kids dealing with our own traumas, he can’t always support me the way I want and that’s not his fault (long distance and I don’t know what kind of help I even need). I don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve always just distracted myself with my vices, or with getting obsessed with TV shows or YouTubers, I’ve tried journaling, I hate talking about my feelings because I feel like they’re not that deep and it feels too vulnerable, it’s like there’s a physical knot in my throat when I try to speak and be vulnerable, I’ve worked out and it helped but I just don’t have the energy anymore. Nothing interests me anymore and everything feels like a lot of effort. Any suggestions?",

She's gonna find out I lied to her.\n\nA few hours after my school counselor told my parents about the things I told him I got a message from my therapist asking me how I am so I figured my parents told her about it and she now knows as well.

Getting dressed, making food, and keeping up socially leave me exhausted. I see somebody in an elevator and I shake with fear. I have pretty horrible coping skills--primarily self-harm through hitting.\n\nAfter I scratched my face from stress accidentally at 13, CPS got involved and I was forced to attend therapy at my school district. I met with a woman that had me draw my feelings. This felt belittling and I decided I didn't want to do therapy with somebody that was less intelligent than me.\n\nI am 21 years old now, and although I am a little cleaner around the edges, I am still running to the bathroom to punch walls and hurt myself to calm down at minor inconveniences. I have fluctuating active SI and honestly believe if I get into a stressful enough situation I will kill myself.\n\nIn college, I have done therapy with a very smart provider and they still said that my symptoms are just due to my intelligence and will exist on some baseline for the rest of my life. Both providers have praised me highly for my intelligence and accomplishments, and in doing that, I believe they are discrediting my suffering.\n\nI want to do therapy with somebody that understands me and won't harp on intelligence. But do I need to see an intelligent provider to have that happen?",

        "Post Text": "Hello everyone! As you can tell from my previous posts, I'm a minor who has recently started attending therapy. Fyi, it was suggested by my parents that I should start seeing a therapist/child psychiatrist after they randomly found out I self-harm, a revelation that caused a lot of turbulence between me and the rest of the family. Today I had my third session, which was wildly different than the two first.\n\nSo basically, I still self-harm about every week, despite the fact that my parents believe I have been clean since they found out in early April. I have also been struggling with suicidal ideation (both vague fantasies and detailed plans) and various self-image issues. Due to my not being of age, I know (my therapist had also told me before) that any healthcare professional is obliged to report me in case of me being a threat to myself (or others), which led to numerous fruitless discussions with her, as I have been lying or constantly saying \"I don't know\" to avoid topics that would get me reported.\n\nToday was no different, except for the fact that I was even less cooperative, due to my therapist asking more targeted questions. She was really trying to get me to open up and I was constantly asking her if she would tell my parents about virtually anything that she wanted me to answer. That went on until the last 20 minutes of our session, at which point she offered me a \"deal\": I could talk to her freely about any type of thoughts of harming myself without getting reported, as long as I promised to call her in case of a related emergency.\n\nAt first, I persisted in denying everything but, in the end, I revealed to her a lot of my thoughts regarding suicide, as well as my current SH habits. I asked her repeatedly whether she was actually going to maintain confidentiality and she reassured me every time that I should trust her word.\n\nTo get to the question, how common is it for therapists to withhold this type of sensitive information from an underage client's parents? Is there a chance she might have lied to me and reported me regardless? Would she theoretically get in trouble if I committed suicide and it was revealed that she had withheld this type of information from my guardians?",

I have known him since we were young, he shares everything with me and we have a very open and understanding relationship built on communication and trust. Recently, I've noticed them becoming a lot more shut down, prone to fits of shaking, and him randomly dismissing himself from the situation.\n\nAs a bit of context, he's always been a bit fascinated with violence and knives and was open with the fact that he dealt with intrusive thoughts. It used to freak me out but through my own diagnosis with OCD and my journey of learning about mental health has made me more understanding.\n\nNow on this one particular night, he broke down and said that he's been having obsessions with particular acts of violence, and how they've just been getting worse. He dreams about it as well. He's started to self-harm because he finds it fun, as they've described to me. They said that they feel insane because he doesn't feel like they're wrong thoughts to have and claims they don't cause him distress, but I've seen how they've been impacting them. I've tried directing him to seek help but he's too afraid to find out nothing is wrong and he's just insane. How can I support them, where do I direct them? I've been assuring them that they don't scare me and I'll be there to support him. I'm not at all scared of them committing any crime, I just am worried about their mental health and their current spiral. I'm not scared of him but I am scared *for* them.",

My symptoms aren't as severe as they were when I was a lot younger, but I do still suffer a lot. Since, it's so hard for me to trust someone for fear of being dumped or abandoned, I sometimes don't tell my therapist everything I'm feeling or what I'm thinking. She does know I have trust issues and have fears of being dumped. In sessions, I can actually control myself a lot more than in the past and not react so intensely. Maybe because I fear so much she's going to dump me? I don't know. My therapist knows about my rage issues because I talk about what happens with friends and ex-friends. She knows about my self-harm and some of my impulsive behaviors. She knows I've been hospitalized a lot for suicidal ideation and I was actually just inpatient recently.\n\nLately, I've been communicating with my therapist outside of session when I'm high on weed or just super emotional and I re-read the texts I've sent and am now concerned that she might know about my BPD because I can't filter the thoughts or the emotional content as much.\n\nCan you tell if a client is hiding their diagnosis?

I did something to hurt myself last night for the first time. I have a lot of cuts but none of them are deep or wide. I don’t need medical care or anything like that. I am depressed but don’t plan on committing suicide. I don’t even plan on hurting myself again, I’m regretting it now. My appointment with my therapist isn’t until Monday, and I’m really wishing I could reach out to her. I’ve reached out to her between sessions via email before, but this is definitely something I don’t want to put in writing. I’m really struggling but not in crisis right now. Would it be okay to ask for a quick phone call tomorrow, or is this a big no? I’m spiraling over this whole thing and could use some support and maybe some tips to avoid this happening again.",

I’m 20, been diagnosed with depression since I was 7. My parents won’t let me use the health insurance for anything non-physical health related. I’ve been paying $40 to see her but she’s now charging $75. I’m paying for my own trade school out of pocket and I also work retail ($12/hr) full-time and I still cannot afford therapy. My parents won’t help by letting me use insurance, it would only be $25, but they refuse. I get no insurance (and do not want it) from my job as they would take $300 out for it if I got it, and I already make $340 a week after taxes.\n\nShe was the cheapest one at $40, everyone else in my area charges $75-$250 per hour session. I told her I quit; she says no and keeps me on the schedule, and it's annoying. I feel so miserable, maybe I should just start edibles and drinking again? I know I’m an ‘adult,’ but my parents refuse to let me use insurance and I cannot afford insurance either.",

        "Post Text": "It's been a year since I left my abusive ex-girlfriend and I'm still not over her. I guess I should start by saying even though I mention self-harm in this post, I'm not actively cutting or suicidal, as of today I'm a little less than a month clean.\n\nI'll start at the start of our relationship. We had known each other since 3rd grade, we met at summer camp, and we started dating when we were twelve. When we started dating, she confessed that she had a crush on me. At the time, I had never had a crush but I said yes, worried I would lose her as a friend if I said no. I didn't have many friends at the time, so I felt I couldn't risk losing her.\n\nAs the relationship went on, I started to have feelings for her like I thought I would, but after a couple of years, it felt like we were starting to drift apart. I was getting new friends outside of the people we mutually knew and we started spending less time with each other. I started to feel like we were going to lose each other at some points. It was at this point that she made her first confession to me, she said she was feeling suicidal. I was panicked trying to convince her not to kill herself, we spent all night on call with each other, I was just trying to get her through the night until I could tell her dad. In the morning, I texted her dad what she told me. I don't know what type of conversation they had other than her dad thanking me after, but when we talked next, she was furious that I had told her dad without telling her. She was so mad that I blocked out what was said exactly, a trauma response from my childhood, but after she calmed down, I tried to ask why she didn't want her dad to know.\n\nAt that point, she confessed that her father was abusing her, that he hit her and he would restrict her food intake as a punishment. I was still young at this point, so I was obviously horrified and scared for her. I would stay up all night with her comforting her as she gave more and more details of the abuse. I started spending every day on video calls with her trying to help in any way I could. When I asked if I could tell someone, so she wouldn't be mad like last time, she begged me not to, she said her dad would hurt her if he found out that she told anyone. At this point, I started bottling up all my feelings because I couldn't tell her my feelings because she always steered the conversation away from them until I was completely breaking down and feeling suicidal. I also felt like I couldn't talk to others because I didn't want to accidentally reveal information she didn't want me to tell anyone.\n\nFor years that was our dynamic, we spent all day every day either hanging out in person or online. I didn't have energy left over to have other friends outside of acquaintances at school. Every time I would start spending less time with her she would tell me more information about the abuse or confess that she was having suicidal thoughts again. I wanted to do anything to keep her alive, at one point where I was incredibly suicidal and weeks away from being in the psych ward we made a deal that we would live for each other if we couldn't live for ourselves. As soon at I got home from the hospital we went right back to the same routine, she told me how much my attempt affected her and how anxious she was every day I was gone, and I comforted her like I always did.\n\nA few months later, she continued to tell more details including having been sexually assaulted by multiple people, including her dad. She told me vivid details about the events and it made my skin crawl every time she did, she kept giving more details even though I was uncomfortable with it. I don't know if this was on purpose or she just didn't notice how uncomfortable it made me because I felt like if I ever told her no she would become suicidal again.\n\nAs we got older (both of us being 17) she started hitting me constantly, she always played it off as a joke but it was always after I had disobeyed or annoyed her, it was also always over stupid stuff too like playing the wrong games or misremembering things about her. At one point when I was about to turn 18 she choked me. I don't even remember why she was mad just that she grabbed me out of nowhere from my perspective. At this point, I basically became a walking doormat for everyone, I still have trouble making decisions for groups of friends even if everyone says it's my choice.\n\nThen a couple of months after I turned 19, a straw finally broke the camel's back. She told me that her dad threatened to sexually assault me and a mutual friend at a sleepover if she didn't listen to him. At this point, I couldn't hold it in anymore, I told my mom everything and she called my ex's mom to tell her what happened. This was the point where I learned who she really was.\n\nOver the next few weeks, more and more details were proven wrong until she finally confessed she made up all of the stories about the abuse. Her dad never hurt her, it was all a parroted story from what her stepsister had told her about the abuse she suffered.\n\nI then told her I needed time to think about everything, I left for about a week, and consulted with the few friends I had and my sister. Everyone told me I had to break up with her, so I did. It never felt like my decision, I just did what everyone else said to, just like she trained me to do.\n\nIt's been over a year now and I still constantly think about what our relationship could have been if I just kept the lies alive, would I be happy again? Every time I try to think of the good times I put together more things that were probably lies, stupid stories that probably don't really matter but I always feel so hopeless in the moment, how much of my childhood did I lose to these lies, I feel like I lost all of my individuality and I don't know if I'll ever feel whole again.\n\nI also lost pretty much everything this past year, my cat, my dog, my lizard, and even my sister (she could be a whole other post honestly), I don't think I've ever had a shittier year in my life. I have glimmers of hope some days but I don't think I've ever felt this depressed. At the beginning of this year I went to the psych ward for a week, I felt much better afterward but I feel like my progress has been slowly being undone. It's been 6 months of constant med changes and 3 months of intensive therapy in the beginning but I've still been in and out of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. I don't have those thoughts right now but every day I'm terrified of what will happen to me if they come back.\n\nSorry for the long post, this has pretty much been my whole life for 7 years so there was a lot to cover. I don't know if I'll have the energy to reply to comments right away, I have a feeling I'll be pretty much wiped out from writing this for the next couple of hours, I'll probably be asleep soon too.",

I don't want to say that it saved my life because that would be hyperbole, but it certainly helped give me the strength to make some necessary changes in my life. I started doing it regularly and slowly I started getting good at it. I felt good about myself. After a while, I added exercise in the gym to get stronger and to get better at the sport I had started to love. I got to know people thanks to the sport, my body looked better, it had many good effects on me.\n\nThen I had a herniated disc. It went undiagnosed for a long time and I just worked through it. After maybe one and a half years, I finally got to a doctor that ordered an MRI and I got the evidence. But there was no help. Just \"don't lift heavy things anymore, k thx bye.\" No perspective. I kept training and ignored the pain. At some point, I got repetitive overuse injury in my elbow, inflamed nerve. At some point, I also developed inflammation of my rib joints, which has only recently been further diagnosed, pending treatment.\n\nOn one hand, I am very grateful for the German health care system. I did not have to pay a lot of money so far for any treatments I've received. On the other hand, I haven't received much treatment. Doctors rarely listen for more than two minutes, either don't know what's wrong or can't change anything about it, just telling me to rest more, spare my body. \"It takes time.\" I feel left alone.\n\nI'm 27 now. Currently, I'm taking a break from all exercise. I haven't done my favorite sport for two months now because the pain was unbearable and I realized that if I want to have any chance at healing, I need to take it seriously. My back is mediocre, my elbow seems to get better very slowly, and my chest hurts. I'm not optimistic that any of it is going away. I tried to compensate with other sports that don't load the injured parts. I did cardio and my knees started to hurt. I did core and glute exercises to work on my figure and it was bad for my chest and back. I don't know what else to try. I'm scared to do anything. I'm also scared to do nothing, to lose my progress, to lose my confidence.\n\nI feel like I was betrayed by my body. I finally started to enjoy doing something with it. Trying to grow, getting in better shape, getting stronger, getting skilled. Now everything hurts. I feel like my body is my enemy. If I could, I would replace parts in an instant. If my body was separate from me and this thought wouldn't be so stupidly self-destructive, I'd want to punish it. Fortunately, I know what's bad for me and I'm not acting on any of this, nor will I. I don't want to make it worse.",

She was very depressed and she got me into drinking at a very young age. It was almost a nightly routine where she would FaceTime me telling me she's going to kill herself or cutting herself on FaceTime with me. This is when my lying started. I'm not sure if I wanted to feel closer to her with her issues or I was just a messed up kid but I lied to her saying I was being hit at home. I know it's so shitty I still feel terrible to this day. Obviously, I was not getting hit, my mom and I would have our fights but that was normal. At this time I also developed an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) which my friend caught onto.\n\nShe decided to tell her mom when I told her all of this, her mom then called CPS (child protective services) on my mom. This is when things started to crumble. I confessed to my mom about my lie and I ended the friendship with my friend because my mom told me she wasn't well for my mental health.\n\nOnce the friendship was over I was still struggling with an eating disorder but I didn't tell anyone, the only person that knew was that friend. I was able to recover by myself when I was 16 after I found a really good group of friends.\n\nThis is when I started to lie more. After I met my now best friend I told her about my eating disorder. For some reason, I still can't explain it to this day, I told her I got hospitalized for it. I never did. This is also when I met my now boyfriend. We started dating at 16 and we are now living together with two cats, it's been 4 years.\n\nI told him the same thing I told my best friend about my eating disorder and how I got \"hospitalized.\" I also added on a new problem, GERD. If you don't know what GERD is, it's gastroesophageal reflux disease which causes excess stomach acid to enter the esophagus causing nausea, heartburn, and possibly affecting the upper sphincter of the stomach (between the stomach and esophagus). I decided to add that lie too saying my upper sphincter was damaged and I had GERD. I have never had GERD.\n\nI've never told my mom about this lie about GERD or my \"hospitalization\" and she obviously knows neither of these things happened to me. I always told my friends and boyfriend to not bring it up around her since she doesn't like talking about it, which was also a lie to cover my lie.\n\nI still don't know why I lied about these things but now that I'm 20 they are all still in my life and my boyfriend and I have been talking about engagement. I've stopped the lying after high school but they still think I was hospitalized for an eating disorder and I used to have GERD.\n\nI don't know if I should just leave the lies to die as time goes on or confess to everything and possibly ruin all of my relationships that are so important to me. I've also never confessed this to anyone, not even a therapist, other than right now on Reddit I guess. If anyone knows why I would have wanted to lie about these things or what I should even do in this situation please help. Thank you.",

        "Post Text": "This one was a while ago, but I want to finally tell someone this part of my life. About a year ago, I had a massive meltdown. The culmination of years of shit happening, from my mom's alcoholism and me having to try to fix it, to my stepdad's antagonistic behavior and deciding that storming out of the house is exactly what an 11-year-old who's currently crying and upset needs, to the constant arguments between them and my sister and her self-harm. Having to act so mature and adult because I didn't feel like I could trust the adults around me to take care of me at times. The bullying I experienced in primary school, the pressure I placed on myself to get good grades in secondary because it felt like that was my only worth as that was all people complimented. Having someone I thought was my best friend suffer a mental health crisis, and then start emotionally manipulating me to get me to stay, threatening to harm or worse if I didn't stay, before offering me money to stay and totally throwing away everything we had. Learning that the school knew the whole time and I was being made to deal with this alone because they weren't doing enough. Moving to uni, having room to breathe, and suddenly having a flood of my own mental health issues because I hadn't had the time to stop and think, and now it was all hitting at once. Years of being told all of my negative emotions were an attitude and forced to bottle it all up and shove it all down. Constantly hearing about how my dad, a man I loved, was abusive, nothing like the man I had grown up with, feeling trapped in a car and unable to say anything as I'm forced to hear it all. It all came to a head one day when my stepdad snapped just a little too harshly at me... And I broke. I couldn't hold back. I shouted and screamed at him, pure emotion coming out. Eventually, he told me just to fuck off, and so I did downstairs. I tried, desperately, to calm down but it was too late. Before I knew it, I was scratching at my arms furiously, in floods of tears, screaming in pure rage. Never had I had such a visceral reaction but it was major.\n\nEventually, I just went silent and numb, shaking after such a violent explosion. Soon, my stepdad came down, asked if I had finished and calmed down and, with vitriol in my words, showed what I'd done in my meltdown and told him it was his fault, that I was done with it and that I resented him. For a second, he genuinely looked wounded and I got this sick, twisted joy from it. A joy that I still have now, a weird satisfaction I felt being able to finally get a word in and have it cut deeply. To see that for once there was nothing he could say in return, he couldn't get the last word, he had to listen to it and take it in. Eventually, we talked about everything and I said I didn't actually resent him but even now, I hold a lot against him and my mom. I can't just let it all go when the damage has been done. It'll go with me for years, I'm not the type to forgive and forget. Maybe one day I'll be able to look at them and not feel some deep-seated irritation or anger, but today is not that day.",

My boyfriend knows about the surface level of these issues since I don’t like to go too in-depth so keep that in mind. It’s my first time posting so hope this makes sense.\n\nI (24F) have struggled mentally/emotionally since I was 15 and have always felt ashamed to talk about my feelings of depression with others. Long story short I’m in the middle of a bunch of changes starting my Masters soon, quitting my job, starting a new job, moving in with my boyfriend of almost 3 years, and just figuring life out. Today started out great, I made my boyfriend and I breakfast, finished a book, and felt motivated as hell and then something shifted in me. I got moody and had a conversation with my boyfriend (that literally wasn’t the biggest deal) that got me so frustrated and upset. I hid in our room and started scratching and biting myself because I was just so angry with myself and overwhelmed. My boyfriend came in a few minutes later to find me curled up in the corner hugging myself. He asked me what was wrong and I couldn’t say anything out of embarrassment. He was patient and after I calmed down I slowly told him about my self-harm patterns and he just enveloped me in the biggest hug. He’s not always the best with feelings and struggles expressing/understanding them but for what feels like the first time in our relationship he expressed everything so well and it was just what I needed. He told me he was so proud of me for telling him something that he knows is difficult and we had a great moment together. I hope I marry this man, I love him so much and want to better myself to be a healthier version of me for the both of us.",

I figured it’d be easiest and most sure way to kill myself without any extreme pain or violence. Plus, Coolant is pretty sweet depending on what kind you get. I specifically got concentrate and not a pre mix of 50/50. But anyway…..I told them I might not wake up tomorrow. They started getting serious in their voice and crying and I couldn’t. So I muted myself and forced myself to throw up outside of my car. I was parked in a really secluded rural area with my car off. I made myself throw up like 4 times until I nothing came out and my stomach hurt from forcing myself. I didn’t tell them what I did but I told them I’d be okay, and that I just didn’t trust myself emotionally. They started freaking out and hyperventilating (understandably) but our call ended shortly after that.\n\n…..I’m still here and I feel fine physically. But Idk….if shit doesn’t workout in my life within the next few months? That’s probably the route I’m gonna go. I’m getting my own place in a couple months so I won’t have anyone to bother anyone. But it’ll be pretty easy to see if anyone actually cares to check up on me. My friends are all across the country, I have coworkers but they’re not exactly friends, and my parents and I barely talk. But I’ve mentioned stuff like this in the past and I never really got any support, just a “hang in there, you’ll be okay” and then they just use it as gossip with the neighbors. So ever since then, I don’t trust to tell them that stuff.\n\nAnyway, I know it’s late and people just talk on here. But when you lose the only person that made you stop?…….well then you don’t really have anyone stopping you anymore. Maybe I’ll wanna keep going if things are going well in a few months. But if they’re not?",

I have been dealing with mental illness and self harm since middle school and despite being almost 4 years clean from self harm, i started self harming again this year. i have lost 50 pounds this year alone due to my situation. I have expended every option and am now going to be homeless at 25. I have spent my entire adult life sleeping on couch to couch and am simply at the age where asking to sleep on someone's couch is too embarrassing for me, but the result is i am going to be truly homeless now. I cannot bring myself any comfort in knowing that in the next few days i will be truly alone without even a roof over my head. So once i throw out everything from my apartment into the trash i will finally kill myself. I have had self harm since i was very young. I have only attempted suicide once in high school, but now that i have the will and means to make sure i do not survive this attempt makes it all a little bit easier. Knowing that i and i alone have this options makes it less stressful on my mental. Living in constant anxiety and dealing with overwhelming self harm and depression for a majority of my life that i have lived has made me feel numb to any and all other emotions I dont feel human anymore.",

I got a good job at a good company that pays well, with great work-life balance, I perform great, I have a loving family, consider myself attractive, I'm dating this amazing girl, have lifelong friends, have never suffered any real hardships, have lifelong friends, and generally have a very outgoing and happy image. And yet I feel so deeply sad, depressed, suicidal, lonely, anxious, stressed. It's been like this my whole life and I'm just exhausted, very exhausted, and knowing that I have all these great things and still feel this way makes me feel even worse.\n\nI got around 50k in savings, and a booked trip to Japan and Korea in October, so I'm planning to just miss my returning flight and just go with the flow traveling the world until those 50k run out.

As my life crumbles around me I'm not sure I can hold on even for him. I've contemplated my demise for as long as my few memories go back. You'd think by now it'd be easier to reconcile my fear and ego with the reality that my existence is futile. There are moments I'm completely at peace with ceasing to exist. And they're becoming more frequent.\n\nI really wish there was someone I trusted to take in my dog. But in person, I have no one. No one I'm attached to or deeply trust. I've never felt a familial bond or a true friendship in person. Ghosts must exist because that's the only way I can describe myself. My therapist said I experienced trauma or something, I guess through emotional neglect. I struggled to get along with my mom, but I wouldn't say she's horrible. We never clicked, and I spent most of my life trying to avoid her. She's always been ill. But, now it's bad. The weight of guilt, buried emotions, and such a shift in my life feels insurmountable. I can only distract myself for so long until I break. If she passes, then I will too. It could be days, weeks, months. I feel like a hologram of whatever person was supposed to be in my place. I'm empty. 'Hope' sounds like some made up designer-drug I'll never have a taste of again.",

BM keeps saying this other dude 'is the dad' just because she's dating the guy. I just don't know what to do anymore. My name isn't on the birth certificate because BM refused to put me on there and it's like, if I go for a paternity, I'mma end up broke and homeless.\n\nI just want to hold her again and tell her that I love her, but I feel it's completely impossible now. I want to take her to the park, and teach her things about the world, about her internal world, and guide her on a good path so she never ends up like me. I can't think of any good routes to take. I can't think of how to go about this situation other than pretending that I never existed...\n\nI don't want to do that to her though. She doesn't deserve that. She deserves a father that sticks by her side, no matter what. I can't be that if I'm not wanted in the picture though. This whole situation genuinely just hurts me so deep. I haven't hurt myself in over 2 years, but this shit... This shit got me wanting to go all the way with it this time.

My mental health is getting worse and idk fuck. I don't know what to do my brain is scrambled and I feel disoriented. My eating disorder got worse, I haven't purged in weeks and before that months. I can't eat it's not that I'm not hungry all I care about is my weight, I walk/run/bike a lot almost 7× the average steps in 35 days (over 400k steps)I just walk the same roads over and over. Big problem is I am allergic to my own sweat and it's hot, I am in the sun for a lot of it. It's just painful the rashes and the deep Bruising from scratching my body. My thoughts about self harm are more constant and all I wanna do is cut I got new blades that are incredibly sharp and I keep thinking about them. The urges to drugs also is hell I'm getting clean I've been clean from meth for 25 days. I haven't been taking My meds and I'm not gonna tell my psych doctor I wanna take them but since the dose and how long it's been since I stopped. 200 mg of Seroquel a night.",

        "Post Text": "Was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and BPD almost a year ago, currently unmedicated (not by choice, lost all insurance at 23). I(23f) fear after years of treatment and medication trial/error nightmares, I may be in one of the more worrisome places in my life. I’ve felt like I don’t want to be here for a long time, but now it’s always my first resort even when I’m not even in that bad of an episode. I started consciously self harming for the first time recently, and there has been multiple times where my mental state was so drastic I had to pull over and stop driving because I fantasized running full speed into a tree or off the highway. Considered hospitalization SO many times, but never did it and now I don’t have the insurance to even support it. I sleep pretty awfully, the one good habit I had throughout my life was always being able to get good sleep. I now feel like I didn’t even sleep or just wake up after 3-4 hours and suffer in the early morning. I’m currently wide awake against my will. To put the cherry on top, a lovely 3 week long visit with my abusive/addict father has caused me to be a monster to my girlfriend. For the first time in our two year long relationship I have been genuinely aggressive, which are signs of the possibility for future physical abuse. I played the therapist eldest daughter the entire trip during my parents active divorce, and now am on track to cut my dad off for said impacts on my family and the influence on my aggression and anger. I did not develop/notice much of my symptoms until I was 18, so I never was aware of how terrible I am doing until now. I also never had thoughts of ending my life or just not being here until 19. I ask this question of am I a danger to myself because as of now it is not a planned thing, but I do fear one more incident might push me over the edge. I’m so deeply tired, and I’m over everything. I have happy moments but the despair lingers in the background at all times. Anything is helpful. Thanks",

I have paranoia where I know it doesn’t or shouldn’t make sense but I can’t shake it. I pull at any strings to connect the dots between these paranoid theories. I know logically they don’t make any sense so I feel like my brain is trying to break the boundary of what “logical thinking” is. Most of my day to day conversation don’t seem real or I look for another meaning to them rather than listening at face value. I insist on finding a deeper negative meaning. I know it’s paranoia because I rarely if ever find a “good hidden message” in what people are saying. My moral compass is pushing me to do things I ethically wouldn’t do or say. Along with morally conflicting thoughts. There is negativity surrounding me that is only worsening it. I usually have a strong will however I seem to be losing it. I constantly have incomplete thoughts. It will start out logical but by the end of their thoughts I don’t even know where they were going or even what has brought them up for that matter. I have done drugs in the past which I do understand has affected me to some extent (including the Marijuana induced psychosis). However after over two and a half years of being sober I was hoping to have some mental clarity but it has only stayed the same if not solidified these delusions and paranoia. I am having more increasing thoughts about suicide and relapsing. I have stayed strong so far however I just recently have had thoughts of self harm. I don’t plan on it since I don’t want marks on myself to stop from opportunistic growth but I have only done it once so I’m concerned as to why I am having thoughts like this again. If you read all of this, thank you for allowing my thoughts to be heard. Just know if you’re having any of these same issues that you’re not alone.",

She said I have mania and not hypomania but I think I have only hypomania. I don't have any psychosis or hallucinations. I don't do any reckless stuff. I just feel extremly energetic begin a lot of different hobbys can't sleep much and talk a lot in that state. I do like spontaneous things. One time when I got my salary I just booked a spontaneous trip which was expensive but If I spend much money on something which is not nessery maybe I balance it the coming month so I'm not in debt or have problems with it. I have a lot of thoughts of doing things Adrinaline related but I don't do it it's just fantasy or thoughts. My sexual drive increases a lot but u don't sleep around I just mastrubate more. I have self harm thougth but I quit self-harm years ago and just snap a rubberband on my arm which helps in these situations. 6 years ago I was an drugt addict and did couple reckless things I think I had mania back than but since 6 years I don't do drugs or reckless behavior. That's why I think I have since 6 years only hypomania and not mania but my psychiatrist says otherwise. I'm afraid that her opinion will effect the medication selection. Does someone have a similar situation or experience?",

I mean it’s completely and utterly unfair. It doesn’t get talked about nearly enough this isn’t a mental health problem because of me. Society has done this to me. I just chose not to participate in this clownery of a society. I don’t push myself to make friends because it’s all fake. Every single thing in this society is blatantly fake. Men have a lot of problems that doesn’t get talked about at all. And I hate it for us men. We get forced to be something we’re not. We get forced to participate in a society that doesn’t respect us and doesn’t respect anyone to that matter including women. Women have it easy . Yes. But doesn’t take away there problems. Society today is so fucked up and I chose not to ever look for a girlfriend because of this because I just can’t get myself to participate in something that infuriates me so much to the point of self harm. I have self harmed. Probably to the point where I damaged my head. I hurt myself badly. Not recent this was along time ago and I hurt my head badly and had stitches put into my head. It makes me cry inside because of how fucked up I became because of my unwillingness to to particpate in society. I go to college so I have direction. And I want to be a therapist because I do believe there is a light somewhere at the end of all this.",

I plan to call my doctor tomorrow about it but I'm freaking out cuz I can't have this happening at work where I NEED to pass the fuck out with the environment I work in. Also I know a ton of people here say u won't have a episode or have any issues going off Lithium at my dosage but I will state right now that that isn't true, I had massive destructive intrusive thoughts, self harmed and other things.

I(23f) fear after years of treatment and medication trial/error nightmares, I may be in one of the more worrisome places in my life. I’ve felt like I don’t want to be here for a long time, but now it’s always my first resort even when I’m not even in that bad of an episode. I started consciously self harming for the first time recently, and there has been multiple times where my mental state was so drastic I had to pull over and stop driving because I fantasized running full speed into a tree or off the highway. Considered hospitalization SO many times, but never did it and now I don’t have the insurance to even support it. I sleep pretty awfully, the one good habit I had throughout my life was always being able to get good sleep. I now feel like I didn’t even sleep or just wake up after 3-4 hours and suffer in the early morning. I’m currently wide awake against my will. To put the cherry on top, a lovely 3 week long visit with my abusive/addict father has caused me to be a monster to my girlfriend. For the first time in our two year long relationship I have been genuinely aggressive, which are signs of the possibility for future physical abuse. I played the therapist eldest daughter the entire trip during my parents active divorce, and now am on track to cut my dad off for said impacts on my family and the influence on my aggression and anger. I did not develop/notice much of my symptoms until I was 18, so I never was aware of how terrible I am doing until now. I also never had thoughts of ending my life or just not being here until 19. I ask this question of am I a danger to myself because as of now it is not a planned thing, but I do fear one more incident might push me over the edge. I’m so deeply tired, and I’m over everything. I have happy moments but the despair lingers in the background at all times. Anything is helpful. Thanks",

I know logically they don’t make any sense so I feel like my brain is trying to break the boundary of what “logical thinking” is. Most of my day to day conversation don’t seem real or I look for another meaning to them rather than listening at face value. I insist on finding a deeper negative meaning. I know it’s paranoia because I rarely if ever find a “good hidden message” in what people are saying. My moral compass is pushing me to do things I ethically wouldn’t do or say. Along with morally conflicting thoughts. There is negativity surrounding me that is only worsening it. I usually have a strong will however I seem to be losing it. I constantly have incomplete thoughts. It will start out logical but by the end of there thoughts I don’t even know where they were going or even what has brought them up for that matter. I have done drugs in the past which I do understand has affected me to some extent (including the Marijuana induced psychosis). However after over two and a half years of being sober I was hoping to have some mental clarity but it has only stayed the same if not solidified these delusions and paranoia. I am having more increasing thoughts about suicide and relapsing. I have stayed strong so far however I just recently have had thoughts of self harm. I don’t plan on it since I don’t want marks on myself to stop from opportunistic growth but I have only done it once so I’m concerned as to why I am having thoughts like this again.

I don’t think I’ll be able to have my own children so I love being an auntie and my brother's kids are just too far away. I moved to Florida in part to see them more. In March, I had a really bad relapse and opened an artery. Ended up in the hospital. My dad made St Patrick's Day dinner for them and I was supposed to be there but he took my sister aside and told her where I was. The following week I was suicidal and needed a place to spend the night and she said \"can't you talk to anyone else\". Since then she's been dodging me trying to make plans and straight-up ignoring me. When I bake cookies for them I am instructed to leave them on the porch without ringing the doorbell. She will not see me without our dad present and acts like I'm some sort of time bomb. I have a lot more self-harm scars on my arm after what happened in March and they've taken over my arm entirely. I understand her choice. It is completely up to her. It just hurts so bad. I love them and I'd never do anything to hurt them. Our dad said she just wants to protect them (they're 3 and 5). Protect them from me. They've already asked about my cuts and I told them I fell into a bush and got scratched by all the branches. They thought that was funny. My sister was mad I lied but what was I supposed to do? I adore them and buying birthday and Christmas gifts for them and spending time with them is one of the few things that makes me happy. Last time I went to my sister's was for Father's Day and our dad had car trouble and I arrived before him and she was visibly peeved. After what my dad said today it makes sense. I just want to say I'm sorry. But I don't know what I'm sorry for. I never meant to make anyone afraid of me. I was just struggling. I wish I had gone back to drinking instead of self-harm. I'd waste my sobriety if I could have a relationship with them again. I've lost so many friends and relationships to my bipolar now I'm losing the people who mean so much to me. I guess I should know better than to think I could make it a few months without this illness taking something from me.",

I just feel extremely energetic, begin a lot of different hobbies, can't sleep much, and talk a lot in that state. I do like spontaneous things. One time when I got my salary I just booked a spontaneous trip which was expensive but If I spend much money on something which is not necessary maybe I balance it the coming month so I'm not in debt or have problems with it. I have a lot of thoughts of doing things adrenaline related but I don't do it it's just fantasy or thoughts. My sexual drive increases a lot but I don't sleep around I just masturbate more. I have self-harm thoughts but I quit self-harm years ago and just snap a rubber band on my arm which helps in these situations. 6 years ago I was a drug addict and did a couple reckless things I think I had mania back then but since 6 years I don't do drugs or reckless behavior. That's why I think I have since 6 years only hypomania and not mania but my psychiatrist says otherwise. I'm afraid that her opinion will affect the medication selection.

I just chose not to participate in this clownery of a society. I don’t push myself to make friends because it’s all fake. Every single thing in this society is blatantly fake. Men have a lot of problems that don’t get talked about at all. And I hate it for us men. We get forced to be something we’re not. We get forced to participate in a society that doesn’t respect us and doesn’t respect anyone to that matter including women. Women have it easy. Yes. But it doesn’t take away their problems. Society today is so fucked up and I chose not to ever look for a girlfriend because of this because I just can’t get myself to participate in something that infuriates me so much to the point of self-harm. I have self-harmed. Probably to the point where I damaged my head. I hurt myself badly. Not recently, this was a long time ago and I hurt my head badly and had stitches put into my head. It makes me cry inside because of how fucked up I became because of my unwillingness to participate in society. I go to college so I have direction.

        "Post Text": "So I just started Strattera last week (target symptoms were fatigue, cognitive inattentiveness/add, motivation, and set shifting). For the record, I also have PTSD and BPD but those are not so relevant but also why I'd wanted to try Guanfacine first. (Or maybe Modafinil?) I'd just had the first good week in months of energy, clear mind, waking up consistently without suicidal dread, motivation, REMEMBERING and recall (I was so shocked -- like WTF is a working memory) etc after stopping Abilify for blood sugar, fatigue, histamine/allergic reactions, and poor sleep. Not my first time on that med and this time was worse than in the past. Suicidality and self-harm had been low and improving a lot also for past few weeks. Also, sleep was regular and consistent for the first time in god knows how long. I'd wanted to try a non-stimulant med for a while but was more interested in something other than an SNRI as the first line. Since she was also upping my Lithium (300-450) and since I'd been on an upward trend of stability AND because I know I am extremely sensitive to meds (I start at low doses, increase slowly, stay toward the bottom of the \"therapeutic range,\" and still consistently have erratic responses and a high incidence of side effects). I asked to be started on 10mg and she just said no that's too low, flat out. (It took me months to get from 0-300mg Lithium and I'm actually responding well this time - have been on it several times with responses ranging from great to meh to god awful). First day I took a dose, became pretty mixed and agitated/dysphoric hypomanic. The next day I was UNGODLY depressed and suicidal. Napped like 4 hours in the middle of the day, went to bed at ~9 pm and was in bed till 3 pm. Every day since then my sleep has been garbage (tossing and turning, not sleeping more than an hour or so at a time -- I have extreme insomnia and have finally started to get it under control so this is really alarming). I have been suicidal, intensely depressed, can't focus on anything, horrific fibro pain and fatigue, less than 0 motivation, can't get out of bed before late afternoon if I'm lucky, exhausted/napping all day. Almost collapsed from a brain zap last night. I cannot live like this. This is already what horrible fibro flares are like...I don't need a med to do this to me. For the record, I've never had a good response to an SNRI or SSRI (manic, mixed, suicidal, can't sleep, hospital) but I've been hoping to get some help with my persistent focus and fatigue and motivation problems (which had actually ironically been improving with stopping Abilify and getting my medical keto stable). I wish she'd just upped my Lithium and said come back in two weeks to keep a close eye and make these changes slowly. But she tried to make it several weeks and make multiple changes at once. I was like ummm how about two weeks? I've tried taking it in the morning, at night, skipping a day, I may just break open the capsules and take a tiny dose and/or not take it every day. But I'm wondering, people who've taken Strattera, who also have fibro particularly, did this med work for you? How long did it take? How well does it work? Did you stop it? When/why did you stop it? I wanted to give it at least a couple of weeks but this is so horrible I don't know if I can make it. I can't live like this. I can't decide if it's worth it to keep trying -- and if I want to just cause I want SOMETHING to work or because I'm being impulsive or because ...?? But this is god-awful. Feeling like it might be wise to stop it, stay on a new Lithium dose for a couple of weeks and try not an antidepressant and say I won't take it if she won't allow me to start at the lowest possible dose...I hate psychiatrists....and for context, I am homeless so days in bed = not making money, not eating/drinking water, not working on my healthcare/housing shit, being unable to keep myself safe, no hygiene, etc etc etc. i.e. it can be catastrophic and just keeps the chronic homelessness spiral going and going and going.",

I study interior design and the classroom was on the fourth floor fall semester and all levels were open below and I couldn’t stand close to the railing because I had such strong thoughts of flinging myself off of it. Good news is we moved campuses and all but one building has one floor. Today we were doing an exercise to understand ADA guidelines using a wheelchair and navigating things like the restroom, etc. At one point we went on the elevator and went up to the second floor. You know what was on my mind. It doesn't seem to matter that I can't actually die that way, it's just pressed in my mind. I'm doing really well lately, it's just these thoughts that come back occasionally and completely take over my mind. I have to walk across this sort of bridge on the second floor once a week to get to my classroom, so I'd like to find a way to quiet the thoughts. I see my psychiatrist pretty soon so I will bring this up with him and see if there's anything he can do medication-wise. Thanks in advance, you guys are the best and I'm really grateful for this community. Hope everyone's feeling alright today.",

        "Post Text": "Recent referral for rapid cycling BP as well as current diagnosis of BPD. Hello everyone, Just looking for advice/ reassurance and opinions. I was diagnosed with BPD in 2019 after previously being diagnosed with Cyclothymia. In the UK often once diagnosed you’re just kinda left to get on with things on your own and then COVID hit so I never got any support and just had to figure things out on my own. I have believed for the past 5 years that BPD explains my manic episodes. By manic episodes I mean; I will suddenly get a huge burst of energy, not be able to sit down, talk a million miles an hour, feel like I’m god’s gift to earth, engage in risky behaviour (take drugs, want to get really drunk (I don’t drink so this is how I usually tell). This will usually last about 2 hours and then die down a little. Over the next 2-3 weeks I will then spend all my money and try and buy things and get loans (I’ve got myself into lots of debt) recently I bought a car and I don’t even drive lol. After this, I will experience 1 month-4 months of complete all-consuming depression. I have now been signed off work for 3 weeks and all I want to do is die. I push through as I am a parent but recently I have been self-harming again. But during these lows I will get almost mini manic episodes. It’s like I’m on cocaine- they last about 2 hours and then an immediate low again. They are very often triggered by opening up about how I feel, listening to certain music, or watching a show/film. It’s incredibly restrictive. Especially as I will engage with reckless behaviour like running away from a psychiatric ward when I was there this weekend. They are also worsened by my anti-depressants but my doctor won’t let me come off them. Is this common with BPAD? To have mania within a low or is it part of having BPD? I have spoken to my therapist about this and said I have had this every year pretty much since I was 13. She spoke to her supervisor and said I should seek a doctor's help immediately. She said she thinks I have rapid cycling BPAD possibly in conjunction with BPD or maybe BPD was a misdiagnosis. This was 2 months ago now and I’m spiralling more and more each day. The meds don’t help and I have to wait 8-16 weeks to see a psychiatrist. I recently tried to section myself (voluntary patient) but there are no beds. So they sent me to a Haven but that made me feel worse and they said they weren’t the right facility for me (god love the NHS). Anyway, I just want to know if this is relatable for anyone, how can I help myself before I can receive help, what can I expect the assessment period to be like? I keep asking doctors but they don’t seem to have anything to say to me. Other than: “don’t kill yourself and wait the 8-16 weeks”. Sorry for the rant. Thank you.",

I’ve been lying to myself all this time, I knew it made me anxious but I thought it would get better somehow. I finally broke down in front of my mom a couple weeks ago so since then I’ve just felt like complete shit even more than before. I wasted all the help I got by being a coward and withdrawing. I feel like such a failure, but the idea of being in another Country responsible for my own socialization makes me feel so anxious. I can barely handle being in public and talking to people so I know it would be the same there. I’m constantly held back by myself. It takes me sometimes hours to do simple things because of my depression and ADHD, I would just be in an endless cycle of being in my room debating if I should go talk to people and feeling bad about not doing it instead of just sucking it up, like I am here. I’m scared that being in another country feeling like that by myself would lead to me killing myself. I’ve struggled with self-harm and while I’m not doing it currently, I don’t know if the urges will come back, and I haven’t had serious suicidal thoughts but that could change being in such a drastically new environment. I wish I could be normal, but I hate myself because I know I can’t make the effort. Thank you if you’re reading and sorry if it’s a little confusing, I’m not good at putting my thoughts into writing.",

I have 0 social anxiety; I just play skibidi toilet in public at 100% volume as a joke idfk why but its funny and then I feel so stupid like 'wtf am I doing I'm not a child why am I like this'. So I wanna change (not just for this there's like a gazillion other reasons I just cba to list them). Anyway, enough yap on the reasons. How do I change my personality? 😭 And I've done a bit of research, I've started making like 'an ideal personality' but how do I actually do it???? I always forget 😭😭 and then I go back to the way I was. It's been so long idk how I can change bc I always slip back, be it after a week or a month or even a couple months or even a couple fricking years I always go back to how I was before 😭😭 Internally, my values and stuff have changed like on the inside I've made progress but on the outside I'm still the same. It makes no sense??? I used to love being alone and now I love helping people I'm a lot more empathetic and stuff but I never really know how to express all this intrinsic stuff idk if this yap makes sense but no matter what I do nothing works 😭😭 Anyway, tldr bc I don't think any of that makes sense: how do I change my personality? How do I change the way I act if I keep going back to how I was before? How do I change my mindset? Edit: I don't think I have enough comment karma to reply to comments so uh I'll add any extra questions 😭😭 Uh so with acting, what if I get burnt out?? Cos I could probs keep up the facade for a bit but I'd get burnt out and I'm in a pretty crappy place mentally rn so I'd probably get burnt out before the faking it makes it 😭 So how do I either not get burnt out doing this (getting motivation to help me, staying disciplined (bc I know how to be disciplined w stuff like homework or exercise but not with this 😭) etc.)??? And how do I let go of 'old me' fully bc a couple years ago I did something similar and it was good for like 2 years or so but I kinda slipped back 😭 And I don't wanna be doing this every year or two I'd rather be able to get rid of 'old me' as few times as possible 😭 Especially since the trigger was a couple of really crappy events that fricked my life up for a bit 😭",

Even when I can read from my phone, I still get nervous. Moreover, there's a small group of people (usually sitting at the front) who, for some unknown reason, obviously dislike me. This makes me shake even more during my report, making me appear unprofessional. I want to ask how I can confidently deliver a report when there's a small group of people in the audience who dislike me. I usually keep thinking about how they dislike me and are staring at me, which makes my already poor performance even worse. I still have a whole year of classes before I graduate.",

(In detail preferably) I've been struggling with picking up on people's social cues especially because I am neurodivergent and end up feeling like the black sheep.. alone, insignificant, and irrelevant. This has been going on for the entirety of my existence and it has been excruciating. I'm usually very loud, disturbingly loud and the one thing I notice is that I tend to drown out the rest of my peers in my own convictions and I feel like that's the main reason that people resent me.

        "Post Text": "Meeting people as an adult - HELP! Hi there, I'm not usually the type to post on messageboards, but I'm at a loss for what to do. I (21F) am very worried about my brother (24M) - I'll call him John. He and I are quite close and have a good relationship, but he doesn't have many relationships outside of our family and his coworkers. John is autistic and has incredibly low support needs, but struggled with bullying, anxiety, and making friends in school. He went to college, but dropped out due to the pandemic. Our home life is stable and safe, but we don't have a father figure and the men that he surrounds himself with are all pretty dissatisfied with their lives. Because of this, he only has one close friend, who is an alcoholic and always pulls my brother into his problems, which has resulted in my brother having some issues with alcohol. Because of everything he experienced in school, John can be pretty cynical and has a hard time trusting people. My brother is a really good guy. He is funny, loyal, a hard worker, an amazing guitar player, strong and, while it can take him a while to get used to change, he is quite smart. He can identify pretty much any car with one glance. I'm scared about the path he is going down with alcohol and depression. I've tried brainstorming ways to get him involved in rec leagues, music groups, etc. so he can meet some new people but I had no idea how hard it was to meet people when you aren't a student. Does anyone have any ideas about how I could encourage him to branch out, ideally without alcohol involved? Even a group with guys and girls would be great, as I've tried to encourage him to meet girls that he actually thinks of as friends/relationship material, instead of just a hookup. Any and all suggestions would be appreciated.",

(TLDR: was in a great mindfulness spot a few months ago, now stressed at work and feel like I’m back where I was) I (30M) feel as though 6-9 months ago I was riding a mindfulness high. Stoicism was alive and well in my brain, and I was happy, motivated, and enjoying every day. My girlfriend had just moved in with me, I was doing a little exercise (has always been a tough habit to form) and things were going great. Over the past 3 months specifically, things have gotten harder. My work stress stays in my mind around the clock and is now the first thing in my mind when I wake up (making waking up really challenging). Living with my SO is still amazing, but we have definitely settled into our “routine” and living together isn’t new anymore. I used to have a nice journey between work and life when work was calm, but now it is hectic and sometimes scary. With all that, I’ve found it so much harder to embrace and remember stoicism and mindfulness. I’ll use medicinal cannabis to help separate my brain from work mode, but this too has just become a habit. My actual question: why do I feel like I’ve regressed, when I’ve learned so many amazing benefits of mindfulness? Any recommendations on how I can start to get back to this? Thank you for any thoughts!!",

I make good tips in a really nice area.\n\nOh yeah and I’m fat.\n\nBut the real problems in my life are that I have adhd and depression which has made keeping employment hard. I’ve been in regular therapy for about a year and last week just switched over to DBT where I’m hoping will help with impulsivity and self control.\n\nI also have a really nice psychiatrist that actually listens to me and doesn’t dismiss me. So a lot of things are looking up. It’s just gonna take a lot of time.\n\nBut hey, I’m healthy with good friendships. So I’m grateful for all of that.",

        "Post Text": "Overcome sexual performance anxiety with mindfulness meditation? When I was 18, I was intimate with a woman for the first time – I was so nervous that I couldn't get a hard-on. That's 22 years ago. But ever since, it happens to me regularly that I can't get a hard-on, especially when I'm with a new partner for the first few times. Even though I feel relaxed and don't feel nervous at that moment. But the only reason I can't get a hard-on is that my brain knows that I once couldn't get a hard-on and that it could become a problem again. So it's just an endless vicious cycle caused by the brain: I can't get a hard-on because my brain knows that I can't get a hard-on. Happens to me roughly three out of four times when I'm with a new partner. And even if I can get an erection, it often only lasts for a short time. But when I'm on my own, I can easily get a hard-on just from thoughts, and keep it hard for an hour if I'm playing with myself. I now finally know that I suffer from what is called \"Performance Anxiety\" or specifically \"Sexual Performance Anxiety\". And I found out that some people are recommending mindfulness meditation to overcome it. From what I've learned over the past couple days, Mindfulness is the skill to be fully present in the moment, aware of what's happening without getting distracted by thoughts about the past or the future. Some companies sell programs to \"overcome sexual performance anxiety with mindfulness meditation\". Has anyone ever tried this? I'm now on the 7-day trial from Betweenusclinic: https://www.betweenusclinic.com/programs/performance-anxiety/how-it-works/ The 8-week program costs only $37, but I also realized that it only contains 8 different 10-minute meditation programs. In week 1, you repeat lesson 1 every day, in week 2 you repeat lesson 2 daily, etc. for a total of 8 weeks. So currently I'm still on lesson 1, which I have to repeat every day, but it becomes boring and harder to stay focused because it's always the exact same voice audio clip I have to listen to. I'm also annoyed by the fact that the voice explains two or three times per lesson that this program will eventually help you to overcome performance anxiety and have a harder and longer erection – thanks for constantly reminding me of my problem, dude! ;) Do I even need a specific program for performance anxiety, or should I just do general mindfulness meditation (guided by an app, maybe)? I'm thankful for any experience reports from men who overcame erectile dysfunction with meditation, or just from people who have experience with mindfulness.",

I used to HATE my face and body because of my acne and refused to be seen without makeup. I went on Accutane despite all the horrible side effects it can have on everything from mental health to joint pain, sexual function etc. For a long time I resonated with body positivity e.g, 'my acne is beautiful!'\n\nMy acne has returned since taking Accutane, and I find that I have a very different relationship with it. My family/genetic background indicates that it might be something that's a part of me well into my 40's and 50's. If you look at my post history, you'll see that I am active in r/acne. I am trying to treat it because it can be painful, but clear skin is no longer something that my emotional wellbeing relies upon.\n\nI have realized that acne influences absolutely no part of my daily life. How lucky I am to have nimble fingers that let me draw beautiful things! How lucky I am that I have legs and a healthy body that let me go for long walks, and runs, and hikes. My mobility and dexterity are not guaranteed, but I am grateful to have both in the present moment.\n\nBeauty is subjective and guaranteed to \"diminish\" with age. There are so many things more important about me than the way I look. I do have to remind myself of this often, but the more often I remind myself of this, and the more gratitude I practice towards the parts of my body and brain that allow me to connect with others and move about in the world - the happier I become.",

I can remember being in a dance class and sucking in in the mirror as an 8 or 9 year old to make myself look skinnier, even though I’ve always been relatively thin.  It got worse when I hit puberty and never “developed” like my friends and classmates did. I stopped growing at an A cup. Because of this, from the ages of about 13-20, I told myself that if I could ever afford it, I was getting a breast augmentation. I thought that this surgery would solve all of my problems and make me finally feel comfortable in my skin.\nBut then I realized, why would I mutilate my body to make myself more attractive in the eyes of society? I only have to wear bras when my shirts are more on the sheer side (before this realization I wore super-padded push up bras every day. Now I have nothing with an underwire in my closet), I don’t have to worry about shirts or dresses being too tight around the chest, I only have back problems because I’m an artist who sits like a shrimp over their work, and I don’t have to worry about the girls hitting me in the face when I run (all complaints I’ve heard from people on the bustier side)\nBody neutrality completely changed my mindset and saved me thousands of dollars. I’d take the braless cartwheels I’m able to do over a chest full of silicone any day.\n\nbtw, this isn’t meant to shame anyone who has larger breasts or has gone under the knife. Your bodies are great too! This is just a post about me flipping my mindset from how my body looks to how my body benefits me.",
